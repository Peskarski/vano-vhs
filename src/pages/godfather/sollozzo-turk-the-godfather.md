Hello my Goodfellas! Who is [Virgil Sollozzo](https://youtu.be/lDnJ6q-fvO0)?

And at the end of the video we'll learn more about the actor who played The Turk in the film! My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Nicknamed [The Turk](https://youtu.be/lDnJ6q-fvO0), because of the way his nose resembled a Turkish saber, and because of his skill with knives, by the events of the first film Sollozzo had already earned a reputation as a successful drug dealer: he owned poppy fields in Turkey, as well as laboratories in Sicily and Marcel. Before World War II, he had been involved in prostitution, maybe that's how he got acquainted with Tattaglia. Turk was considered the ideal partner, able to provide financially for his family and keep his mouth shut if busted.

In New York, [Sollozzo](https://youtu.be/lDnJ6q-fvO0) enlisted the help of the Tattaglia family in his new project and bought a warehouse in Manhattan from which he could conduct business. He also secretly conspired with Barzini, who became the mastermind of the scheme against Corleone. He then went to Don Vito, wanting money and protection. Vito, however, refuses, believing that the drug business will damage everyone. But during the meeting, Sonny Corleone expressed an interest, which led the Turk to believe that if Vito dies, Sonny will cooperate.

Vito Corleone calls [Luca Brasi](https://youtu.be/vef9UXpdegg) in order to use him to get close to Sollozzo, forcing Luca to pretend to defect. Luca begins hanging around Tattaglia's nightclub complaining about Corleone. Bruno notices this and suggests that Brasi become an enforcer for Tattaglia. Brasi warns Bruno that he won’t go up against Don Corleone, but Bruno promises that he won't have to. The night before assassination attempt on Don, Luca puts on a bulletproof vest and takes a revolver with the intention of killing the Turk.

Upon arrival, Luca meets Sollozzo. The Turk, after promising friendship, a job and 50 thousand bucks, suddenly plunges a knife into Luca's hand, and the killer strangles him from behind.

Soon, Sollozzo's men try to eliminate Vito, having decided that Vito's eldest son, Sonny, will take over the family. To seal the deal, Sollozzo kidnaps consigliere [Tom Hagen](https://youtu.be/tAVhMyvSZY0), takes him to an abandoned diner and tries to convince him to make a deal. Hagen promises to try, but says that if Brasi finds out the don is dead, not even Sonny can stop him. Hagen had no idea that Sollozzo killed Brasi an hour earlier. Corleone family members first learn of Brasi's death when they receive a bag of dead fish wrapped in Brasi's body armor, a sign that Brasi "sleeps with the fish."

Now let's find out, why did Tom Hagen seem to support Sollozzo? It's simple! The consigliere was facing the truth. Sollozzo was right in saying that heroin was the future. But Vito was also right in stating the imminent death of the Mafia if they got involved with illegal substances. Both sides were right in their own way, a simple conflict of interest.

After managing only to wound Vito, the Turk sends the assassins to the hospital, where the guards are off duty by order of the police captain, who is on Sollozzo's payroll. At this time Vito's youngest son, Michael, comes to visit his father and, after discovering the absence of guards, informs Sonny. With the help of Enzo the baker who arrives, Michael manages to scare off the assassins.

Sollozzo informs McCluskey that [Corleone](https://youtu.be/lPmk-ev2zEw) is still alive and in protection: an enraged cop rushes to the hospital. Trying to reason with McCluskey, the enraged cop punches Mikey in the face, breaking his jaw, but Tom Hagen comes to Michael's rescue.

On the night of the same day, Sonny orders Bruno Tattaglia to be killed in retaliation for the assassination attempt on Vito. As long as his father is alive, Sonny won't even think about the deal. Santino then gives Tattaglia an ultimatum: hand over Sollozzo or a war will break out. At the same time, Hagen discovers that Sollozzo was in McCluskey's protection, which means that to kill [Sollozzo](https://youtu.be/lDnJ6q-fvO0), McCluskey will most likely have to be massacred.

Then Michael makes an unexpected suggestion. Referring to the fact that Sollozzo will certainly strike again, Michael offers to meet both of them in person and kill them. Sonny and Tom were skeptical at first, but Michael managed to change their minds.

Soon [Sollozzo](https://youtu.be/lDnJ6q-fvO0), along with McCluskey, meets Michael at a restaurant. Michael is searched before the meeting, however, one of Clemenza's men manages to hide a revolver in the restroom of the restaurant.

The conversation between Sollozzo and Michael was in Sicilian, with Sollozzo assuring that the attempt on Don's life was just business, nothing personal. However, when Michael began to speak in English and demanded assurances that Vito would be left alone, Sollozzo brushed it aside, saying that he was only interested in a truce.

Michael goes to the restroom to get a revolver. On his return, he grabs the gun and shoots Sollozzo in the forehead, killing McCluskey as well. Because of their deaths, the five-family war breaks out. Michael is forced to go to Sicily until things subside.

Virgil Solozzo is based on Vito Genovese. The Turk may also be inspired by Vincent Papa, who was a key figure in the French Connection. Papa was closely associated with the Lucchese crime family.

The murder of Sollozzo is a reference to the murder of Joe Masseria. Masseria was killed in a restaurant while meeting with Lucky Luciano, who arranged the murder. Shortly after Luciano went to the bathroom, four armed men burst into the restaurant and killed Masseria.

Sollozzo's dealings in Sicily suggest that he was a Sicilian Mafia member, which would explain why he was treated with respect by the New York dons. During a restaurant encounter, Sollozzo notes that he is a "man of honor," a phrase typically used to denote a member of the Mafia.

In the film, the Turk was portrayed by [Al Lettieri](https://youtu.be/lDnJ6q-fvO0). The actor was an American of Italian origin. His brother-in-law was Pasquale Eboli, brother of Genovese crime family boss Thomas Eboli. While preparing for the role of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino personally encountered Pasquale. And here's the proof: in the picture you see a young Pacino, Pasquale and Lettieri together, respectively. Lettieri passed away from a heart attack in 1975, three years after his greatest role.
