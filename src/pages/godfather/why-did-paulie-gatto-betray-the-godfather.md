Hello my Goodfellas, today we're going to talk about [Paulie Gatto](https://youtu.be/qX1lEVpL_iE), the famous traitor from the movie The Godfather! You'll learn the details of his biography, why he had the brains to defect to Sollozzo, how the character influenced our beloved series The Sopranos, and what were those mattresses Clemenza wanted to go to! My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Paulie was born to Richie Gatto, one of Don Corleone's bodyguards, and his wife Ursula. As it happens, Paulie was in the same grade as Michael Corleone. In 1934, his pops was gunned down in a shootout with an Irish mob. For his commitment, his wife and son were supplied with everything they might need, and Paulie, once he grew up, was able to join the Corleone family. Under Pete Clemenza's leadership, he turned into his protégé and the faithful soldier of the Corleones.

To avoid losing a promising soldier, Clemenza stepped in for Paulie, arranging for all the certificates required for exemption from military service, stating that Paulie was being treated with electric shocks for mental disorders. Clemenza had so much faith in his apprentice that he allowed him to make a living from armed robbery, which, of course, went against family rules.

It's not in the movie, but those who have read the book know that Gatto was among those who took revenge on the bastards who abused Amerigo Bonasera's daughter: Paulie made sure that the boys learned their lesson once and for all, which brought him the respect of the family.

But the music didn't last long: at some point Gatto defected to Virgil Sollozzo and deliberately took three times sick leave, leaving Fredo to defend the Don all alone. We know very well what a defender Fredo is. So it's not surprising that the third time Vito almost had his life taken away. Of course, wishing to maintain a low profile, Sollozzo's men called Gatto several times from a public pay phone across the street from Vito's HQ. But what Pauline did not know was that Corleone had several phone-service employees on the payroll, one of whom had whispered to Sonny.

After learning the name of the mole, Sonny instructs Clemenza to kill the "stronz" (Italian for "shit"), as Santino referred to him: Clemenza delegates the business to Rocco Lampone. Peter took Poli's betrayal to heart, for he personally helped Paulie go over the heads of more skilled and faithful soldiers. To sedate Gatto's alertness, Clemenza and Rocco circled the car for several hours, looking for suitable places where Corleone's soldiers could "go to the mattresses" Clemenza then ordered Paulie to stop the car, and then Rocco shot Paulie three times in the back of the head. Rocco took over Paulie's role in the family and also became Don Vito's new driver. Later, Clemenza informed Sonny that he would never see Paulie again. It is worth noting that when Sollozzo found out about the demise of his mole, he didn't sweat it much, as he had already managed to get rid of Corleone's main ace, Luca Brasi. If you're curious about the real story of Luca Brasi, which wasn't shown in the movie - pay attention to [this video](https://youtu.be/Aui3WSExFiI)!

**And so, what does it mean to go to the mattresses?**

In simpler terms, to get into a military confrontation with another Mafia family. In more detail: A mafia family rents housing for 10-20 family members for the period of the conflict. They get mattresses as sleeping places. All members live in a tiny flat in order to protect themselves from the assaults of the enemy. They move in groups and do not appear in singles. You may remember the scene from the first movie where Pete Clemenza is raring to teach the younger Corleone how to make pasta sauce for lots of mouths to feed? Clemenza anticipated that such expertise might be necessary, and he didn't fail!

**Now let's figure out why Paulie had the confidence that he would eventually get away with everything?**

It's fairly simple: Gatto decided that he had a chance to climb the career ladder rapidly, to become a "big shot”. Most likely it happened because of Paulie's young age and immense ambition. We all want the magic pill that will take our lives to the next level in the blink of an eye, don't we? But, as is often the case, everything has a flipside.

Paulie didn't want to take the long-term career. After all, if he had stayed loyal to the Corleones, and gone through the hardships with the family, he would have been one hundred percent likely to get a promotion. I disagree with those who considered Paulie dumb. Whatever, but he wasn't dumb: Clemenza didn't make him his protégé for nothing. Gatto even had people under his own command. He probably didn't think Barzini and the other big players were using him as a bargaining chip. If even the experienced Tessio had fallen into that trap, then what about the twenty-six-year-old guy?

**Interesting Facts**

How did Gatto's character influence the Sopranos? It's no secret that David Chase refers to "The Godfather" regularly over the course of every season of The Sopranos. In fact, the movie is mentioned more than 50 times during the entire series. So I think it's essential to bring up the Paulie Gatto and Paulie Galtieri character connection.

Paulie Gatto's character in "The Godfather" betrays his boss Don Corleone, which almost leads to his death. Gatto and Galtieri share the same name. They also share the identical initials: P.G. I'm still convinced that Paulie also betrayed Tony Soprano in the show's ending. What do you think? Let me know in the comments down below!

Originally, the role of Paulie Gatto was supposed to go to Robert De Niro, but De Niro was given the role in another film, which Al Pacino turned down. The irony is that it was because of this very occasion that De Niro would star in the Oscar-winning role of young Vito in The Godfather II.
