Hello my Goodfellas! [Luca Brasi](https://youtu.be/vef9UXpdegg) was Vito Corleone's personal enforcer. Fluent in Italian and ready to withstand any combat, he had a dark reputation in the criminal world as a [ruthless goon](https://youtu.be/vef9UXpdegg). In the movie, the character is completely inconspicuous. Moreover, it never shows why we should be afraid of him at all! But we really should! And you are about to learn exactly why! My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Luca was originally from an Italian family in Rhode Island and had an abusive childhood because of his alcoholic father, who frequently beat him and his mother. Luca eventually decided he had enough and murdered his father shortly after he caused his wife to miscarry by stabbing her. Later, Luca killed his next-door neighbor by pushing him off the roof in revenge for his mother's impregnation.

In the early '30s, Brasi turned into a serious thug. It was around this time when he met Kelly O'Rourke, who would become his girlfriend. Luca was tremendously attached to her (he almost killed Tom Hagen for sleeping with her, though Tom didn't realize she was Brasi's woman) and occasionally used to beat her up, yet he also had a strange, deep affection for her.

Once she became pregnant, though, Luca attempted to force her to abort the baby, but she declined. On the day his son was born, he pressured the midwife Philomena, at the risk of death, to throw his son into the furnace, an action she has never forgiven herself, calling Brasi "an unholy demon”.

Tales of Brasi's bravery soon became a legend. One of these experiences involved the assassination by Brasi of Benny Amato and Joey Daniello, two henchmen Al Capone hired to kill Don. Brasi tied them up and gagged them with towels. Then he slowly chopped Amato into pieces. When he decided to finish off Daniello, he found that the latter had choked on a towel.

The talent of Brasi was that he could do the job alone, without any accomplices who could rat him out. Since Luca left no witnesses, this made a criminal conviction almost impossible. He was also known for eliminating six men trying to kill Don Corleone in two weeks.

One of the six succeeded in putting the don in the hospital, which triggered a series of murders by Luca, and he would continue, but Vito recovered and called him off. These six deaths ended the famous ["Olive Oil War."](https://youtu.be/lPmk-ev2zEw)

Shortly before Vito Corleone underwent an assassination attempt, Brasi was called in by Don, who intended to lure out rival Mafioso Virgil Sollozzo by having Luca pretend to switch sides. Luca began hanging out at Bruno Tattaglia's nightclub complaining about being held back by Don Vito. Bruno spotted this and began meeting with Brasi on a regular basis. He offered Brasi a job as an enforcer for Tattaglia. Brasi seemed swayed, and warned Bruno that he would not go against Don Corleone, but Bruno pledged that he wouldn't have to go against Don. On the night before Don was shot, Luca met with Bruno, who had made an appointment for a later evening. Brasi hails a cab to his quarters to get ready. Before going to the meeting, Luca put on a bullet-proof vest and took a revolver with the particular intention of whacking Sollozzo.

At the meeting, Luca encounters Sollozzo. Luca and Sollozzo negotiate business while Bruno oversees the meeting. Sollozzo, after offering friendship, a job, and fifty grand, plunges a knife into Luca's hand, pressing it against the bar, and the assassin chokes him from behind. 

This is how Luca's death in the movie looked like, but in Puzo's novel things were a little different, as Luca prepared for the fateful encounter far more thoroughly than it wasn’t shown in the movie. I have gathered all the differences between the book and the movie in a [special video](https://youtu.be/KBXBMLWGfNY)!
