Hello my [Goodfellas](https://vano-vhs.com/), today we will talk about [Genco Abbandando](https://youtu.be/yLmkzr0Lq0w): what is known about him? How did he become a Godfather's best friend, what significant scene with his character was removed from the movie, and which of his heirs we saw in The Godfather 3? My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

After his arrival in New York, Vito was adopted by the [Abbandando](https://youtu.be/yLmkzr0Lq0w) family and later befriended the family's son, Genco, who became more like a brother to him. Genco and Vito formed a lifelong relationship that would have remained strong even if Vito had never established the Corleone family.

Genco grew up in Little Italy and from a young age worked in his father's grocery store alongside Vito. Jenko gets terribly upset when Vito leaves the store at the fault of [Don Fanucci](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather/why-did-vito-corleone-get-away-with-killing-fanucci/), the local racketeer. Determined to help his friend out, Genco even offers to steal his father's food, but Vito flatly refuses, expressing that it would be offensive to him.

After becoming the new Don, Vito assigned Genco as consigliere and named his company "Genco Pura" in honor of his friend. The choice was made for a reason: Genco was used to crime, and he was familiar with the street. For this reason, he faithfully served him with amazing savvy. And when [Sonny Corleone](https://youtu.be/yiGneBQhJ6M) got into the family business, the clever consigliere entrusted the young man to work as his father's personal bodyguard, so that the young man could watch over the family business and be under Vito's control.

After the [Olive War](https://youtu.be/lPmk-ev2zEw), when [Vito Corleone's](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather/why-did-vito-corleone-get-away-with-killing-fanucci/) power became more established, Genco and his family moved into a house on Vito's estate in Long Beach. If you're curious to know what the conflict was, I will leave a link to the video at the end!

Until Genco was stricken with cancer, he continued to be a savvy and effective assistant to the don. Then his place was temporarily taken by Tom Hagan, Vito's adopted son. He died in the don's presence in 1945, twenty-four hours after Connie Corleone married Carlo Rizzi. The don's sons and his godson, Johnny Fontaine, visited Genco to honor his memory.

Years after, in the 70s, Genco's grandson, Dominic Abbandando, would serve as Don Michael's press adviser when the Corleone family became considered legitimate. Dominic would routinely have to answer media questions about the not-quite-legitimate aspects of the family.

**Then there is a reasonable question**: why not give Genco a more substantial role in the second movie? Genco had an important role in Vito's life, he was a consigliere for a long time, and Vito's company was named Genco Pura, not Tessio Pura or Clemenza Pura! It should be understood that for Vito he was a brother, not a business partner, like Pete or Sal.

I don't know if you're aware of it or not, but there's a deleted scene in the first film where Don goes with his sons to pay final respects to Genco, who is on his deathbed. Genco shocks Vito, begging Don to ward off death. As you may recall, a Sicilian has no right to refuse a favor asked of him on the day of his daughter's wedding. Up to that point, Vito has dealt with life and death issues daily, but he is not a god, nor is he in a position to influence the fate of his old faithful friend. 

On the other hand, this scene is a marker for us, the audience. From what we have seen, we realize that for many people Vito was a kind of god: so we can imagine how powerful Vito really was.

Also, it's worth noting that when Genco was in good shape, Vito made almost no mistakes, at least ones that he later had to regret. And why is that? That's right, because Don had his faithful consigliere, Genco Abandando, at his side. And, notice, as soon as Tom Hagan becomes the Don's consigliere, everything falls apart: the Don sends Brasi to meet Sollozzo, who was no idiot, as a result of which Luca goes to the fishes; and Sollozzo himself, whom Vito rejects, becomes not only a problem for [Corleone](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather), but also a direct threat to the Don's life. I think if the disease hadnâ€™t hit Genco, the problems would have been solved most rapidly and without loss. As we remember, when Don gets a bullet and is in a hospital, Sonny freaks out and declares to Tom that he is a worthless wartime consigliere: you might remember, I wish I had Jenko now, then my enemies would start crying! What do you think, write in the comments?
