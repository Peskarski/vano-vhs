Hello my [Goodfellas](https://vano-vhs.com/) The [Olive Oil War](https://youtu.be/lPmk-ev2zEw) became a serious brawl between the [Corleone family](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) and Salvatore Maranzano that changed Corleone's life completely. But what caused the confrontation, how were the events related to the real Mafia, and how was the oil involved in the first place? Let's discover in a moment!

The movie shows this briefly, but the [Godfather](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) book pays quite a lot of attention to the Genco Pura Olive Oil Company. Genco Pura is a shell company founded by Vito Corleone in the 1920s. The company was named after Vito's childhood friend/consigliere, Genco Abbandando.

Genco Pura was a front for [Corleone's](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) criminal activities. In simple terms: Tony Soprano borrowed this scheme for his not-quite-legal business, only in Tony's case it was the waste recycling company.

In 1933, the abolition of Prohibition affected the [Corleone family](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather), but Vito wasn't hesitant: he sent his men to Salvatore Maranzano, a mafioso who ran the Manhattan gambling business, a big shot in the New York underworld. Vito's men offered Salvatore a partnership beneficial to both parties. With his influence, Vito could help Maranzano expand his influence in Brooklyn and the Bronx. But Maranzano blatantly refused the offer, triggering the Olive Oil War.

Maranzano had a mighty organization. He was a friend of Al Capone, and he had strong relations with the Tattaglias, who were the major pimps in town. He also had connections with the influential politicians who benefited from his black services.

**What does Maranzano do?** He calls Capone, asking him to send his two best men to eliminate Don. But Vito was one step ahead: he had his own spy agents in Chicago who told him of Maranzano's plans. Don involves Luca Brasi, who, along with his men, gets rid of the intruders in an extremely brutal way.

After the events, Vito sends Capone a message with a few kind words. Capone receives a letter, and is so impressed by it that he soon declares that from now on he will not get involved in Corleone's affairs. Then the forces are leveled, and Vito gets a great deal of "respect" in the criminal underworld of the States, putting Capone in his place.

For six months Vito had been rubbing Maranzano's nose in it. He confronted his enemies on all sides, heavily assisted by his trusted friends Clemenza and Tessio: the latter was sent by Don to get Maranzano's head in person.

At this point, Maranzano was fully convinced that he was losing, and he sent his men to offer a truce. But Vito refused to accept them on various grounds. Maranzano's enforcers were withdrawing from his organization, obviously not willing to get into a mess. Moreover, bookmakers and loan sharks who had previously dealt with Maranzano now began to send Corleone money. The war was coming to an end. Finally, on New Year's Eve 1933, Tessio succeeded in getting to Maranzano himself. Maranzano's men wanted peace more than anyone else, so they eagerly agreed to send their leader's head under the scaffold. They lied to him that a meeting was to be held at a restaurant in Brooklyn with Vito himself, and that they would take care of Maranzano's security.

When push came to shove, the "protectors" made a run for it, leaving the boss sitting at the checkered table, when Tessio and four other young men showed up out of nowhere. The execution was fast. Maranzano, with a mouthful of bread, received a lethal dose of lead. The war was over, and what used to be Maranzano's had gone to Corleone.

**And now about the true events that inspired Puzo!**

The Castellammare War was a bloody confrontation for the Italian-American Mafia's control. On the surface, the war was between the forces of Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. In fact, however, it was a war between the old Sicilian Mafia and the younger generation of Italians, those born in the United States or who came to the country as kids. The latter knew English better, were more flexible in their criminal enterprise, and were eager to do business with non-Italians if it meant a profit. Tensions between the two families began as early as 1928, when one side often stole truckloads of liquor from the other. Nevertheless, the makeup of the two families was constantly changing. Many gangsters during the war might have defected to the enemy and killed their former companions.

It is hard to say when the war actually commenced. However, according to most sources, the first shot was fired by Masseria: on February 26 he ordered the assassination of the associate Gaetano Reina. Masseria ordered the murder of Reina by Vito Genovese, which the latter accomplished. In this way Masseria intended to protect his secret allies Tommy Galliano, Tommy Lucchese and Dominic Petrilli. This, however, did him a disservice as the Reina family shifted its forces to support Maranzano and the conflict reached a sharp stage where the sides stopped counting human casualties and stopped at practically nothing.

On August 15, 1930, Maranzano supporters killed Masseria's chief enforcer, Giuseppe Morello. Two weeks later, Masseria received another strike. After Reyna's murder, Masseria put Joseph Pinzolo in charge of the ice distribution racket. On September 9, however, Reyna's family shot and killed Pinzolo. After these two murders, the Reyna family officially teamed up with Bonanno.

Masseria soon strikes back. On October 23, 1930, Joe Aiello, president of the Chicago Sicilian Union, was murdered. It was commonly assumed at the time that Capone, as an ally of Maranzano, had killed Aiello as part of a power struggle in Chicago. However, Luciano later acknowledged that it was Masseria who ordered Aiello's murder, and it was carried out by his ally Alfredo Manfredi.

After Aiello's assassination, the situation shifted in favor of the Castellammara faction. On November 5, 1930, Alfredo Manfredi and a key member of the Masseria crew, Steve Ferrigno, were both killed. Then the Masseria Gang members, believing that there was a clear imbalance of power in favor of their boss's rivals, began to run over to Maranzano, essentially trying to save their asses. On February 3, 1931, another important Masseria lieutenant, Joseph Catania, was wounded and passed away two days later.

Given the deteriorating situation, Masseria's allies, Luciano and Genovese, began negotiations with Maranzano. They agreed to surrender Masseria if Maranzano would stop the war. On April 15, Masseria was killed while dining at a restaurant.

With Masseria's murder the war was finished. The winners, at least on paper, were Maranzano and the Castellammare faction. Seeing firsthand the level of violence that the criminal underworld in America had led to, Maranzano made a series of amendments in order to avoid situations in the future. Many of these changes are still in effect today.

Maranzano established a separate post for himself. He assigned himself "capo di tutti capi," in other words, boss of all bosses.

According to the new rules, each family had to be led by a boss, assisted by an underboss (the third rank of consigliere was established later). Families were divided into capo-led brigades staffed by soldiers. Often the soldiers were assisted by associates who were not yet Mafiosi. The associates could have been non-Italians, like Meyer Lansky or Ben Siegel.

However, the music did not play for long: On September 10, 1931, a team of assassins arrived at Maranzano's office. The hitmen, wanting to do everything in quiet, tried to put Maranzano under a feather, but he resisted so furiously that the young men had to shoot him. According to reports later received, the hit team was formed by Meir Lansky. In the end, both old-school families lost the war. The real winner was the young, ruthless generation of thugs led by Luciano. With their rise to power, organized crime reached the national level, becoming multi-ethnic.
