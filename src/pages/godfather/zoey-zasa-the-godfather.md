[Joey Zasa](https://youtu.be/Pit9MCfE-Wo) started running the Corleone family business in New York in the seventies. The character of Zasa appears only in The Godfather 3, and originally by the director's plan he shouldn't be there at all, he comes to replace another famous character, which we know from the first and second movies. Who exactly? You'll learn at the end of the [video](https://youtu.be/Pit9MCfE-Wo)! My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Zasa was one of the original members of the old Peter Clemenza regime. In the years following the death of Franky Five Angels, Zasa was promoted, with the Commission's and Michael Corleone's blessing, to manage the Corleone family's affairs in New York.

Zasa became feared and, to a certain degree, well-respected among his underworld associates in New York for his business savvy and total cruelty. Moreover, he rose to power at a time when Michael was determined to make the Corleone family a legitimate power. Furthermore, by the time Zasa became highly notorious, people were becoming disdainful of the gangster way of life. So Michael endeavored to keep Zasa at arm's length.

Zasa gained the disfavor of the Corleone family by his flashiness and desire for celebrity, as he drew unwanted public attention to his criminal activities. Zasa failed to get along with the bastard son of the late Sonny Corleone, [Vincent Mancini](https://youtu.be/FJtwzKRTpng). Michael was irritated by Zasa's "fame" and the fact that he was actively engaged in drug dealing - to the point of selling dope to children. Zasa denied that his guys were involved in the drug trade, and claimed that he would kill anyone if he knew. Yet Michael, unfortunately, trusted his word more than his own nephew, who tried to make it clear to Michael that Zasa had publicly offended Michael behind his back. After the two were asked to reconcile, Mancini bit off a piece of Zasa's ear, for which he was later attacked.

Willing even more power, Zasa conspired with Don Altobello and Licio Lucchesi to have Michael assassinated as part of the Immobiliare fraud. By the way, Puzo borrowed the Immobiliare story straight from real life. If you want me to make a video about that, let me know in the comments! If Michael were gone, Zasa would embezzle Corleone's estate and would become the capo di tutti capi of New York. As part of the scheme, Zasa sought to kill Michael during a Commission meeting in Atlantic City. Michael escapes, but nearly all of the other Dons are killed on the spot.

A short time after, in the heat of a religious festival, Zasa and his men and Nicky, the casino host, were celebrating, when Zasa spotted Lou Pennino scratching at the Cadillac that Zasa had posted as a prize - as it turned out later, it was a deceptive move. At this time, a disguised hitman, who was carrying a statue of Mary in the parade, pulled out a lupara, and with a single shot sent the "Ant" to his forefathers in the anthill. Zasa tries to flee and, while trying to get into the locked shop, gets a triple shot in his back from the cop, who turned out to be a dressed-up Vincent Mancini.

**Interesting Facts**

Joey Zasa is a compound of Mafioso Joe Colombo, Crazy Joe Gallo, and John Gotti. In fact, John Gotti, like Zasa, was a rough and flashy figure known as "the most elegant gangster‚Äù.

Joe Colombo sought to stop the making of The Godfather and then made a deal with producer Al Ruddy under the terms of which the words "Mafia" and "Cosa Nostra" wouldn't be used in the movie at all. Colombo was shot a few months later during a public speech, just a couple of blocks from the filming of "The Godfather."

Originally, Coppola and Puzo envisioned Willie Cicci to be the main villain of The Godfather III, but due to the sudden death of actor Joe Spinella, who played Willie, Cicci had to be dropped from the script: he was replaced by Joey Zasa.
