Hello my Goodfellas! Why exactly did [Peter Clemenza](https://youtu.be/d4hOGBjhCgw) become Vito's right-hand man and then Michael Corleone's next? And why didn't Richard Castellano reprise his role as [Clemenza](https://youtu.be/d4hOGBjhCgw) in The Godfather 2? Let’s find out! My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Born in June 1889 in the Sicilian province of Trapani, Peter Clemenza emigrated to the United States at a very young age, relocating to Hell's Kitchen in New York City and leaving behind his brother Domenico, who subsequently became a Mafia boss in Trapani. He soon befriended another fellow young man, Salvatore Tessio. Clemenza grew to be known as a polite but brutal man in the neighborhood, merciless in protecting his properties and his businesses. With this, he interested Don Fanucci, but Clemenza dismissed the idea of having a "boss." Clemenza turned his attention instead to the mentoring of young Vito Corleone.

As a young man, Vito held a blanket of weapons for Clemenza so that the cops couldn’t detect him. Clemenza repaid that favor by stealing a carpet for Vito's family with Vito's unintended assistance. Their roles were later swapped when Vito murdered Don Fanucci, becoming the group leader. Friendly and cheerful, Clemenza was known as a storyteller among his many acquaintances and family members. Peter Clemenza began trading stolen merchandise with Vito and Tessio as early as 1917 and became a crucial figure in the growing Corleone family. Vito kept him around for years, making him godfather to his eldest son, Santino, though this was to control his ambitions.

During the [Olive Oil War](https://youtu.be/lPmk-ev2zEw), Clemenza was an essential member of the family, and his street savvy enabled Vito to discover more about his foes, most notably the feared enforcer Luca Brasi, who eventually joined the Corleones.

Clemenza played a key role in helping Sonny after Vito was shot, despite the fact that he was initially being accused of being a frame-up. When it was discovered that Paulie Gatto was the true betrayer, Clemenza was assigned to get rid of him: Clemenza entrusted the task to Rocco Lampone. Peter took Paulie's betrayal to his own credit, for he personally helped Paulie go over the heads of more experienced and loyal soldiers. To put Gatto's alertness to sleep, Clemenza and Rocco rode in circles for several hours, looking for suitable places where Corleone's soldiers could "lie down on mattresses" in the coming war. Clemenza then ordered Paulie to stop the car to take a piss, and then Rocco shot Paulie three times in the back of the head. Rocco took over Paulie's role in the family and also became Don Vito's new driver.

When Vito's youngest son, Michael, suggested getting rid of Sollozzo and McCluskey in one go, Clemenza trained him to use his guns to commit murder while reducing his chances of being caught. The plan worked, and while Michael hid in Sicily, Clemenza prepared for a full-scale confrontation against the remaining families.

As Vito's most trusted friend, Clemenza was assigned to keep a watchful eye on his son-in-law Carlo Rizzi and the bookmakers he owned in Hell's Kitchen. Clemenza kept tabs on Carlo through his contact Sally Rags, who informed him of Sonny's violent attack on Carlo in 1946. The war later ended Sonny's life, and Vito returned from the hospital after the assassination attempt.

Peter Clemenza visited Sicily in 1950, where he met with Michael Corleone to arrange his safe return to America and to supervise the safe transfer of family friend Salvatore Giuliano. He also selected new recruits for the Corleone family. At that time he was briefly reunited with his brother Domenico. Giuliano was later murdered by his friend Gaspare Pisciotta. Michael and Clemenza return successfully to the United States.

In the '50s, Clemenza and Tessio requested the opportunity to establish their own families, because Barzini was stealing their territories. Let me explain here a little: the term "family" has a different meaning in Mafia society; it is not an institution composed of mothers, fathers, children and relatives. In its narrowest sense, a family (or a clan) is a criminal gang that operates either on a unitary basis or as an organized association of smaller groups.

[Michael](https://youtu.be/Z3-x70YwDxo) tells them to wait, to which Clemenza reluctantly agrees, but Tessio refuses to wait and makes a deal with Barzini that leads to his demise. Clemenza stays loyal and kills Victor Stracci in person as he exits the elevator. He also strangles Carlo Rizzi, Connie's husband, in revenge for Carlo's participation in the assassination of her brother Sonny. At a meeting with Michael, Rocco and Neri, Clemenza calls Michael "Don Corleone" and kisses his hand, a sign that Michael has become his father's successor in all respects.

Through his loyalty and many years of service, Clemenza was given control of the Corleone family's business in New York and proceeded to run operations out of the old Corleone compound. He also acted as Michael's off-the-record consigliere as the family took its first moves toward legitimate activities. Even though he was by no means young, he still maintained the fuse he had in his youth and was aware of all that was happening on the street. It was from Clemenza that Michael found out about rumors of his brother Fredo's being bisexual.

Clemenza died, presumably of a heart attack, in 1958 while preparing meals for his men at his beloved diner. He was succeeded by Frank Pentangeli, his loyal man and trusted friend. There were rumblings that the Rosato brothers were somehow involved in his death. Willie Cicci and Frank Pentangeli claimed that Peter's death was unnatural, though Michael and Tom Hagan denied the rumors.
