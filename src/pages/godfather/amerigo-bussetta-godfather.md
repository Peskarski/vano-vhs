Hï»¿ello my Goodfellas! I'm betting many of you who watched The Godfather 2 wondered, who was [the man in black](https://youtu.be/KyncNF3Pflc) who followed Michael around and who, without saying a word, succeeded in bringing horror to the audience just by looking at us. He also sent Uncle Junior to the fishes without moving a single wrinkle. Well, it's time to learn some more [about this guy](https://youtu.be/KyncNF3Pflc)! My name is Ivan Piatouski, and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

The gentleman in black is called Amerigo Bussetta, a Sicilian Mafioso who was Michael Corleone's private bodyguard and a professional assassin who accompanied the Don on his business trip to Cuba.

[Amerigo Bussetta](https://youtu.be/KyncNF3Pflc) was born in Sicily to a very poor family. At a relatively young age, he had started to kill for cash and became famous for his murderous skills. [Don Tommasino](https://youtu.be/G6SwajdQ82Y) soon noticed him and took him under his roof. Next, Bussetta became part of the Corleone family when Michael brought him to America (after Amerigo's exile from Sicily), later Bussetta became Don's personal bodyguard during the conflict in Miami. Now a little on the conflict itself.

The Miami conflict was a major event in the game The Godfather 2. It was a huge war between six Crime Families (Trapani, Mangano, Almeido, Granado, Rosato), and the Roth Syndicate.

In Cuba, where [Hyman Roth](https://youtu.be/wK_p8U2Bte0) called a meeting of the heads of the criminal families on New Year's Eve, where he intended to turn over his hotels, casinos and other possessions to Trapani, Corleone, Granado, Mangano and Almeida because of the exclusive government system that allowed for a partnership between the government and the criminal families. Soon, however, the Cuban Revolution came, in which the rebels prevailed, and the regime of Fidel Castro had begun. This ruined Hyman Roth's plan, which was the only thing that kept the families from entering the conflict.

The conflict in Miami, and most of the families and events in it, are only portrayed in The Godfather II game, and have not appeared in the movies or books. So I suggest you install the game and play it: all the actual links to Godfather games are in the description! But let's get back to Bussetta!

Bussetta wasn't much of a wordsmith and was known to follow Michael's orders with extreme ferocity. He also followed his boss around all the time, escorting Michael to Hyman Roth's house in Miami in case of emergencies.

On New Year's Eve 1958, Bussetta broke into Hyman Roth's hospital room in Havana, having previously killed Roth's lieutenant, Johnny Ola. Bussetta apparently attempted to strangle Roth with a pillow, but unexpectedly Cuban troops burst in and shot Michael's man several times, killing Bussetta instantly on the spot.

The part of Bussetta was played by Amerigo Tot, the Hungarian sculptor. The Amerigo Tot Museum in Budapest is named in his honor.
