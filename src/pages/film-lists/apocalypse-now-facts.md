Apocalypse Now is an epic war film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film's screenplay is based on Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel Heart of Darkness, with a change of setting from the late 19th century Congo to the war in Vietnam. Well, [Vano VHS](https://vano-vhs.com/) put together some curious facts that will show the movie from a new perspective!

1. The careful viewer will be able to spot that in the scenes with Dennis Hopper, the phrase "apocalypse now" written on the houses of stone.

2. In the Philippines, where the movie was shot, all the sets had to be destroyed after the shooting was completed. The director made the original decision to blow up all the sets and film it in case it would come in handy. In the original 35mm film version, the credits at the end of the film ran in the background of these shots, and many thought this was an indication that Willard had called in the bombers after all. Upon learning of this reaction, Coppola cut this footage from the end of the movie and left just the credits. He denied that the bombing of the Kurtz settlement was considered as an alternative ending to the film.

3. Originally George Lucas was supposed to be the director. There were plans to shoot the film in Vietnam in a partisan manner, but Warner Bros. refused to fund such a project for security reasons and doubts about box-office success.
4. Learning that Coppola was making a film that did not align with the official view of events in Vietnam, the U.S. government refused to help in making the film. The director then enlisted the support of the Philippine government, with which the U.S. authorities had a troubled relationship.
5. Francis Ford Coppola starred in a cameo as a journalist.

6. Filmed material took about 15 hours, so the editing was protracted for two years. The first draft of the film lasted more than five hours and had to be reduced for distribution. At the Cannes Film Festival in 1979 the three-hour version was presented as "unfinished work". Ultimately, the movie took the Palme d'Or, and at a press conference Coppola said the famous words: "My film - not about Vietnam, it is - Vietnam.
7. Al Pacino refused to play Willard, telling Coppola, "I know what it's going to be like. You're going to sit there in the helicopter and tell me what to do, and I'm going to be stuck in this swamp for five months." The director joked that filming would have to be relocated to Al Pacino's apartment if he accepted the role of Colonel Kurtz.

8. Some photos of Colonel Kurtz were stills from the movie "Glare in the Golden Eye," in which Marlon Brando starred as the officer.

9. On the set, the director had to put up with the caprices of Marlon Brando. The actor was paid a million dollars in advance, but he constantly threatened to leave the film. Coppola told the agent that he was ready to invite a replacement for Jack Nicholson or Robert Redford. Brando did stay, but refused to read the original script and the novel, taken as its basis. The actor only agreed to improvisation and allowed himself to be filmed only in the dark.

10. To make the hotel scene more plausible, Martin Sheen drove himself into a depression and excessive use of alcohol. To get back into shape, the actor needed a long time, and Coppola considered stopping filming. To avoid this, Martin was replaced by his brother Joe Estevez. He also revoiced some of the dialogues.

11. Harrison Ford was allowed to name his character himself. The actor named him J. Lucas.

12. The rumors surrounding Apocalypse still circulate, saying that Coppola and the rest of the crew shot the film while under the influence of marijuana and LSD. That would explain a lot.
