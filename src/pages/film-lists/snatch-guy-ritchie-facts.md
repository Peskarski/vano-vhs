Hello my Goodfellas! Once [Guy Ritchie](https://youtu.be/RRkIcHjvF4I) produced "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," the opportunities opened up for the director were completely different. The budgets rose, and many big-name stars turned their attention to the talented filmmaker. Well, I put together [some curious facts](https://youtu.be/RRkIcHjvF4I) that will show the movie from a new perspective! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://youtu.be/RRkIcHjvF4I)!

1. Brad Pitt once said he would like to star in one of Guy Ritchie's next films after he watched "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".

2. They offered Brad the part of a gypsy fighter, and he was a bit cautious, because the actor had recently appeared in the movie "Fight Club". Brad Pitt was not willing to be fixed in such a role, but his wish to work with Guy Ritchie turned out to be more powerful.

3. The part of the gypsy did not fall to Brad Pitt for nothing. The fact is that the actor could not reproduce the London accent properly. Ultimately, Pitt's personage talks in such a strange way that no one but his fellow gypsies are able to comprehend his words.
4. In addition, Sean Connery enjoyed the screenplay. Nevertheless, the actor simply could not allow himself to work for a small, by his own standards, pay. However, Guy Ritchie, therefore, was unable to afford to pay the typical Sean Connery royalty.
5. Besides, the shooting of ["Snatch"](https://youtu.be/RRkIcHjvF4I) brought in a number of actors who had previously starred in "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".

6. Former soccer player Vinnie Jones was Guy Ritchie's biggest discovery. In "Snatch," he went on to play more or less the same part. Vinnie Jones applied for the part of the gypsy boxer, yet his accent was also ill-suited.
7. Ade, who starred as Tyrone in the movie, arrived on the set to get a job as a security guard. But Guy Ritchie spotted him and offered him a role in the film.

8. While writing the scenario for his first feature film, Guy Ritchie made up many scenes on the basis of the stories of his contacts and on the basis of the crime bulletins. Something similar he did when penning the script for "Snatch", with the most ridiculous crimes being taken from criminal reports.

9. One of the special features of Guy Ritchie's movies is dialogues. They take up a rather large chronological length and include a large number of profanities. This characteristic appears in "Snatch" too, the "f\*\*k" word is uttered 153 times in the movie.

10. The crew had a rather motley crowd on the set, so it was necessary to keep discipline under control. A system of penalties was established by Guy Ritchie. Fines were imposed for any lack of discipline: for being late, for sleeping during working hours, for not clearly following the instructions of superiors.

11. Curiously, eventually Guy Ritchie was unhappy with the resulting film and claimed that he even managed to fall asleep at the pre-release screening. However, with time, he appreciated his work, stating that each time he watched the film, it was hard to remember what was going to happen next.

    On the other hand, viewers and shareholders immediately praised the film. On a $10 million budget, "Snatch" grossed $83.5 million globally.
