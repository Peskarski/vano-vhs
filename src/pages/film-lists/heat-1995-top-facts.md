["The Heat"](https://youtu.be/zaxaWzNoBCE) is one of the best crime films of the 1990s. And in the staging of shootings the film has no equals to this day. The main parts were played by Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight and Ashley Judd. It was directed by [Michael Mann](https://youtu.be/zaxaWzNoBCE).

**Some interesting facts**

1. Usually sounds are added to a film at the post-production stage, but director Michael Mann decided to go a different way, and in the bank heist scene he placed hundreds of microphones in the street that recorded sound in real time. It was this that produced the kind of natural effect that no one has yet replicated.
2. Michael Mann explained that Al Pacino's words about "great ass" were not in the script and that's why actor Hank Azaria's amazement in that scene was so genuine.

3. Actress Amy Brenneman had long refused to star in the film, citing that there was too much blood and idealizing of outlaws. Director Michael Mann agreed, adding that this attitude was why she would be the perfect choice for the role of Edie.
4. [Robert De Niro](https://youtu.be/jVh_Y9nFm4o) insisted that the scene where his character meets Al Pacino's character in a restaurant should not be rehearsed. Sort of, that way the acquaintance would look more authentic. Director Michael Mann agreed and the scene was shot without any preparation. De Niro claims that he agreed to be in the film precisely because of the cafe scene.

5. Actor Don Johnson was considered by Michael Mann as a replacement for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, in case either of them was unable to take part in the shooting at the last minute.
6. Jon Voight initially turned down the role of Nate, suggesting that there are many actors who would play this character better than him. Mann was able to convince him that he wrote the role specifically for him, because he had long wanted to work with Voight.
7. Keanu Reeves almost got the role of Chris Schicherlis, but when Michael Mann found out that Val Kilmer could squeeze the role in "The Heat" in his schedule, he turned Reeves down and signed Kilmer. Sometimes Kilmer had to work on the set of "The Heat" during the day and go to the set of "Batman Forever" in the evening.
8. The quick change of magazines at the carbine by Val Kilmer's character, in the shootout scene on the Streets of Los Angeles, is considered a benchmark. It is regularly shown to U.S. Marine Corps recruits.

9. Since the release of The Heat, a similar pattern has been followed by armored car robberies in South Africa, Colombia, Norway and Denmark. In 1997, the shootout that arose after a bank heist in North Hollywood, which is considered one of the longest and bloodiest in American police history, gained notoriety. The criminals tried to act just like in the movie and confronted the police on their way out of the bank, after which the shootout continued on the streets of the city.
10. Robert De Niro was the first to get the script for the movie, after which he showed it to Al Pacino, who immediately agreed to a role in the film.

11. The composer Elliott Goldenthal wrote the music for the film's finale, but at the last minute Michael Mann favored a Moby composition called God Moving Over the Face of the Waters. Goldenthal still used the composition he had written in Michael Collins (1996).
12. Michael Madsen was originally signed for the role of Michael Cerrito, but was replaced at the last minute by Tom Sizemore. For what reason this happened is undisclosed.
13. Actress Gong Li ("Memoirs of a Geisha") was offered the role of Al Pacino's character's wife, but she turned it down because the script was not translated into Mandarin (North Chinese). Director Michael Mann did work with Gong Li in the movie "Miami Vice" (2006).

14. The train station shown at the beginning of The Heat of the Day, the same one in which another Michael Mann film, The Collateral (2004), ended.

15. In the early '90s, Michael Mann sent the script for "The Heat" to director Walter Hill ("Red Heat," "48 Hours," "Single Hero"), with an offer to direct the picture. Walter Hill declined. After that, Mann decided to take on "The Heat" personally.

*The production budget was $60 million. Box office gross of 187 million.*
