* [Robert De Niro](https://youtu.be/zaxaWzNoBCE) was born to a creative family. His mother was interested in art - painting and writing poems. She just met her husband at a university class of artist Hans Hoffmann. The actor's father (by the way, his full namesake!) is a famous sculptor and author of paintings in an abstract art style.

* As a child, the hero was involved with a bad bunch of teenagers. But it helped him not to become a neighborhood bully because of his passion for the theater.
* The actor's career began with the simplest of school plays. No one knew that in a few years this charming boy would enter the famous High School of Art in New York. Coincidentally, it was there that another movie star, [Al Pacino](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/), also studied.

* Robert De Niro's first "amateur" role was the fearful and timid Lion from "The Wizard of Oz", and his debut role on the big screens came out only 6 years after the end of filming due to the bankruptcy of the company. We're talking about "The Wedding Party".
* The man made his mark not only as an actor, but also as a director. Making the film project "The Bronx Story" was connected with sorrowful events - with the demise of his beloved father. After 20 years, the movie was adapted into a musical.

* Some of the most notable acting works include "Taxi Driver", "Once Upon a Time in America", "Goodfellas". One interesting fact: the participation in the film ["The Godfather 2"](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) was very much awaited by the actor himself. He failed to play in the first movie, but the second was beloved by millions of fans!

* Taking his profession seriously is a distinctive De Niro trait, for which he is especially respected by film directors. As an example, for the film "Taxi Driver", he trained and intentionally drove around the city and even got a driver's license. And for filming in "Raging Bull" gained 25 pounds, completely changing the appearance.
* Actor's transformation skills and drastic ways of "getting into" the role did not go in vain and paid off. Rob can boast of two "Oscars" - for the role of [Vito Corleone](https://youtu.be/vDYZ19R2yRo) and Jake La Motta.

* A person who is successful is always successful in every way. The man has not stopped at filmmaking. He has his own restaurant, Rubicon, which he runs jointly with the director Francis Coppola, a network of Japanese cooking establishments, and even a hotel.
* Charismatic and charming, he has enchanted many women throughout his life. However, the actor has personal preferences concerning the search for a partner. Dark-skinned beauties especially resonate in his heart. The man has been married twice: to Diane Abbott and Tookie Smith. In 78 years he has had 6 children, whom he never forgets about and continues to take care of.
