Hello my Goodfellas! [Taxi Driver](https://youtu.be/rnoPtD81Po4) is a 1976 American neo-noir psychological drama thriller directed by [Martin Scorsese](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJE-RJqUo77QVbJ3pWwt3YioOrJXc8Fb), written by Paul Schrader. The film follows Travis Bickle, a veteran working as a cabby, and his deteriorating mental state as he works nights in the city. Well, I put together some curious facts that will show the movie from a new perspective! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [Vano VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

* Paul Schrader, who wrote the script for the film, was a bit “crazy”. He suffered from depression and couldn't sleep without a gun under his pillow for a long time. While working, he was constantly driving around the city at night, and on his return, he was drunk out of his mind, and in that state he wrote a draft of the script for "Taxi Driver”.

* Originally the film was going to be directed by Brian De Palma, a friend of Scorsese. The leading role, a New York cabby Travis Bickle, was supposed to be played by Jeff Bridges. However, when the project was handed over to Scorsese, he suggested the role to [Al Pacino](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/), which was rejected. And only after that they called [Robert De Niro](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/robert-deniro-facts/) into the movie.
* To play the role De Niro for a month for twelve hours a day worked as a cab driver in New York. During this time he studied all sorts of aspects of mental illness and tried to live and eat, exactly as his character.

* Jodie Foster, who played a teenage hooker, picked the role from 250 contenders. They included Kim Catherall, Roseanne Arquette, Michelle Pfeiffer and even the future "Star Wars" star Carrie Fisher. However, by the beginning of filming Foster was only 13 and she was unable to take part in a number of explicit scenes - her older sister Connie replaced her in them.
* Cybill Shepherd got into the picture accidentally. For a long time Scorsese was unable to find an actress for the part of Betsy. This despite the fact that the requirements for candidates included a note: the type similar to Shepherd. The Shepherd’s agent found out about this and asked the producers an obvious question, "Why search for an actress who looks like Cybil, if you can ask her directly? Curiously, at that time Shepard was dating filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, which, however, has not stopped her from having an affair with both Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese.

* The role of Spott Matthew, the pimp, was chosen by Harvey Keitel himself. The script had only a few scenes and a handful of replicas. Despite this, Keitel thoroughly approached the case. He specifically interacted with the real pimps, absorbing their manners. And later completely improvised a dance scene with Jodie Foster.

* Martin Scorsese makes two appearances in Taxi Driver. First time you can see him in the episode when Travis is watching Betsy from the car. The second is when he plays one of the cab passengers. In the latter case, Scorsese substituted actor George Memmoli. He was supposed to play this small role, but during the filming of the movie "Farmer", he had an accident.
* The director explains that the most important scene in the movie is the one in which Bickle attempts to negotiate a new date with Betsy. The camera shifts at one point from Travis to the long, empty corridor. All of this symbolizes the painfulness and difficulty of this conversation for the protagonist.

* The scene where Travis talks to himself in front of the mirror was totally improvised by Robert De Niro. The more interesting thing is that this is the episode that male actors most often pick for an audition. And its key phrase, "Are you talking to me?" is among the ten most popular movie quotes in the history of cinema.
* "Taxi Driver" is considered one of the most frequent inspirations for all sorts of nutters. One of those, John Hickley, found a personal message in the film. After that, he harassed Jodie Foster for several years, threatened Jimmy Carter, and then attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. Then there's another crazy "Taxi Driver" fan, who, however, limits himself to on-screen violence - filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.
