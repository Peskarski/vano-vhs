Leonardo DiCaprio is the kind of actor who is unused to losing. Each of his appearances on the screen becomes a notable event, and it seems that this will continue. Rarely does a movie premiere featuring him end up being a flop. "I'm a happy little son of a bitch," the actor says of himself. Well, we've put together some curious facts that will show Leo from a new perspective!

**At the Uffizi Gallery in Florence**

Leonardo DiCaprio was called after the famous artist and innovator Leonardo Da Vinci. The fact is that his mother was just looking at a painting by Da Vinci when her son first moved in her belly.

**The Break**

After his hard work in The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio took a two-year break from filming due to nervous exhaustion. The break ended with work in the movie "The Revenant." The habit of total dedication has led to the fact that Leo, having received for this role "Oscar", again went on a lengthy vacation. He traveled to different countries and worked on a documentary about wildlife and how it should be protected, before appearing in the next feature film, Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood".

**Education**

DiCaprio only graduated from a regular high school, he has no higher education. But he can play organ!

**A New Name**

Early in his acting career, his agent persuaded ten-year-old Leo to change his name. Lenny Williams, in his opinion, would sound more American. But the little actor declined.

**Leo Knows Everything**

Tom Hardy has a tattoo with the words "Leo knows everything." The tattoo appeared after Oscar nominations were announced in 2015. DiCaprio thought Hardy would be nominated for an Oscar for his work in the "Survivor," but Hardy assured him he wouldn't. They made a bet, and since the nomination did happen, the Englishman had to comply with the terms of the bet. He delayed for a long time, explaining that Leo had terrible handwriting and all the sketches he sends, unacceptable. In the end, however, he got the tattoo - apparently, it was the last option he agreed on.
