The most famous film in the history of cinema. [Francis Ford Coppola's film](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) drama blew up the world of cinema then, and continues to be so relevant today. The accuracy of details, the story telling, the script, the acting, are still so good that they are studied in cinema classes and in drama schools. Now, [Vano VHS](https://vano-vhs.com/) will tell you twenty-five fascinating facts about the very first part of "[The Godfather](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather)."

* During the shooting of the scene in which the bed with [Vito Corleone](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather/why-did-vito-corleone-get-away-with-killing-fanucci/) on the mend is carried in his arms, Marlon Brando came up with a very funny trick. He took dumbbells under the blanket in order to make fun of the crew. Far from everyone laughed, and the actor himself was quick enough to make it apparent that there was a certain reason why it was so hard to bear him.
* During the scene where Sonny smashes the FBI agent's camera, [actor James Caan](https://youtu.be/yiGneBQhJ6M) totally improvised. He wasn't supposed to smash the object or rip it out of his hands. What happened was a total unexpectedness, which is why the reaction to the event turned out to be so genuine.
* The Paramount Pictures company routinely made it difficult for the group to function. In particular, they constantly wanted to remove Coppola under the excuse that he wasn't keeping up with the schedule, was making a lot of mistakes, and was far out of budget. These were personal issues, and so the producers had to reassure the bosses at the studio. Ultimately, the movie turned out beautifully, was finished earlier than expected and even at a lower expense than what was originally budgeted for the project. Paramount was also unhappy with [Al Pacino](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/)'s performance as an actor. They kept demanding that he "Start acting already!" Paramount didn't think it was worth paying much money for his role as the reserved and quiet [son of a mob boss](https://youtu.be/Z3-x70YwDxo). In the end, these claims were also removed as the story progressed, and the studio itself had no regrets about the fact that it still managed to see the actor in action.

* The scene in which [Vito Corleone](https://youtu.be/vDYZ19R2yRo) slaps Joe Fontaine is also an improvisation. Actor Al Martino didn't expect Brando to punch him, so his bewildered facial expression was a true feeling, not an act. James Caan said that Martinot was "so taken aback that he didn't know whether to cry or laugh."
* The animal rights movement was extremely outraged that a dead horse's head was used in the film. Francis Ford Coppola responded by saying the following: "So many people were killed in the film, but it's the horse that bothers everyone. It was the same thing on the set. When the head was brought in, everyone was very upset. All the animal lovers, all the little dog lovers. And what I didn't tell them was that we got this head from a dog food manufacturer who has to kill about two hundred horses a day to keep these little dogs fed."

* It was Gabriel Torrey, who starred as Enzo in the film, who was acting for the first time. In fact, the actor was very much afraid of the movie set, and he simply chickened out all the time.
* Gordon Willis, the cameraman, deliberately made the film so dark as to emphasize the dark dealings of the Corleone family. For this film he (justifiably, I think) was nicknamed "Prince of Darkness" jokingly by his colleagues.
* [Marlon Brando](https://youtu.be/lPmk-ev2zEw) refused to learn the text and read almost everything from cards or improvised.
* Every time an orange appears in the movie (and in [the trilogy](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) in particular), that means that someone is going to die.

* Attention to detail is very important. That's why most of the bumpers in the movie were wooden. In reality, they were actually taken for the needs of the army during World War II.
* The scene in which [Sonny](https://youtu.be/yiGneBQhJ6M) beats up Carlo was filmed for four days. More than 700 people were involved during the filming.
* Marlon Brando refused to show up at the Oscar ceremony, where he was given a statuette for the role of Vito. The actor claimed that the United States constantly oppresses people of indigenous origin, so he will not take the award. 
* Orson Welles (director of Citizen Kane) attempted to do whatever it took to get the role. He even promised to lose enough body weight to be able to play in the movie. Coppola, who was a big fan of Welles, still rejected his offer because he initially thought that only Marlon Brando was qualified for the role. 
* According to [Al Pacino](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/), Marlon Brando really cried in the scene in which Michael puts his life in his father's hands.
* Al Pacino had boycotted the Oscar ceremony. What he disagreed with was that, with more timing, he was nominated for a supporting role and not as the lead actor in the movie.
* The word "Coppola" is used to refer to a traditional Sicilian fedora. These hats are routinely seen in the movie itself.

* The name of a town in Sicily where many Mafiosi actually lived was Corleone. It was impossible to shoot in the original environment because the city looked too modern in the early 70s. Unlike the city of Savoca, where the shooting took place.
* Vito Corleone's voice was copied by Marlon Brando from Mafia member Frank Costello. The actor saw him at a 1951 hearing and liked his soft, ingratiating voice.
* [Al Pacino's](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/) maternal ancestors came from the town of Corleone in Sicily. It was from there that they emigrated to the United States, exactly like Vito Corleone.
* Despite numerous reports that Coppola was consulting with members of criminal factions about the making of the movie, the director himself constantly denied it. At the same time, producer Al Ruddy's second wife claimed that the final script was "approved" with Sicilian boss Russell Buffalino. Whether or not this is true remains a mystery.
* The phrase "[Drop the gun, take the cannol](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather/peter-clemenza-the-godfather/)i" was invented by Richard Castellano himself.

* Coppola insisted on calling the movie "[Mario Puzo's The Godfather](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather)," so much so that he wanted to reflect the author's involvement in the work.
* According to Mario Puzo's own statements, Johnny Fontaine's character is not based on Frank Sinatra. But audiences were not to change their minds, they made their verdict, believing that it was Sinatra, who got the role in the movie "From Here to Eternity". This was also the case thanks to the rumors that were going around in the film industry at the time. For the rest of his days personally, and afterwards in the words of his biographers, Sinatra had to deny this rumor.
* The song "Speak Softly Love" was nominated for an Oscar, but when it turned out that Nino Rota had simply reworked parts of his own work for the movie "Fortunella", the nomination was cancelled.
* The TV series "[The Sopranos](https://youtu.be/-MGkuTjp4Ak)," which in many ways inherits both the idea and even the straight quotes, quite a bit of the plot takes place in a bar called "Bada Bing." It's a reference to a line [Sonny Corleone](https://youtu.be/yiGneBQhJ6M) uses in The Godfather: "You've got to get that close, and bada bing!"
