1. **For he was a strong supporter of Stanislavsky's system**. Marlon Brando praised the famous theory of stage craftsmanship, developed by the legendary Russian director. As a firm supporter, the actor with his first film work significantly raised the benchmark for acting in American cinema and served as a model for such actors of the next generation, as Omar Sharif, [Al Pacino](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/), Warren Beatty and [Robert De Niro](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/robert-deniro-facts/).

2. **To the role of Colonel Kurtz in the "Apocalypse Now"**. What the actor said, while working on the role, was that he simply let fear take over completely. "Terror has a face," and it's the face of old Brando looking out of the darkness. The actor put the "Apocalypse" crew through their paces, arriving on the set rather fat, disrupting the schedule, and then later rewriting the screenplay. Brando called the director's plot silly and ruled: Colonel Kurtz is neither a fool nor a sadist, but a kind of practical philosopher who rejects earthly morality. This estrangement from the world is what makes his even voice and stare so frightening.

3. **For constantly challenging Hollywood.** In the land of glamour, the actor arrived in shabby jeans, a T-shirt, and a leaky jacket. The actor did not know how to conduct himself and did not want to fill his head with such crap. Brando did everything differently. Insulted prominent journalists, was rude to the producers. The newspapers gossiped absentmindedly about him, and he did not get tired of giving for this all new reasons. Meanwhile, the youth literally prayed to their new idol. The teenagers mimicked his gestures and his gait, T-shirt and shabby jeans were the most fashionable clothing. And Hollywood was resentful: how this "redneck" who could not hold a fork and knife, and who does not really know the right people, so quickly burst to fame?

4. **For refusing an Oscar for stepping up for the Indians.** Marlon Brando was awarded a second Oscar for his role as [Vito Corleone](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather) in the movie ["The Godfather"](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather). His character - boss of gangsters - has been a long way from the well-behaved gray-haired gentleman with a soft voice and a cat on his lap before the hunched, slovenly, not cut old man, that could not fail to delight the American Film Academy. However, the actor refused to receive the Award, citing his act as a protest against deep-rooted in American society policy of discrimination towards Native Americans. During the Oscar ceremony, a young Indian woman, nicknamed Little Feather, took the stage instead of Marlon and announced to a confused audience that Mr. Brando refuses to accept the award as a protest against the infringement of the rights of indigenous people of the continent.

5. **For saying the phrase "Everybody Lies" before Dr. House did.** As Marlon Brando was far into his seventies, he decided to film a 15-day workshop called Lies for Life, which involved his friends Sean Penn and Leonardo DiCaprio. Asked why he chose to call his project something like this, the actor responded that the title was more than just a provocation. According to the actor, life is impossible without lies. "I've been lying my whole life. Everybody lies," said Brando.

6. **For he knew how to be a friend.** Mr. Brando never concealed the fact that he kept the urn with the ashes of his close friend, actor Wally Cox, with whom he had been intimate since the age of ten, at his home, bequeathing his ashes to be scattered along with his own. When Cox's widow learned of this from the interview, she tried to sue for the removal of her spouse's ashes, but the judge found no subject matter here. Brando also had a strong friendship with Jack Nicholson, which he carried through his life. When Brando was gone, Nicholson said: "Everything changed dramatically with his death."

7. **For his contributions to the world of cinema.** When talking about Marlon Brando, one of his biographers Stephan Kanfer once stated: "There was cinema before Brando and after Brando, just as there was painting before Picasso and after Picasso, literature before Hemingway and after Hemingway, and pop music before Sinatra and after Sinatra." Along similar lines was the film historian Molly Haskell: "The legend of the silver screen can be characterized by one word. Brando. As Garbo. Or Fido. There is only one Brando."
