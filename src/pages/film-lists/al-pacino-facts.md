Despite being born in the most mediocre New York City, [Al Pacino](https://youtu.be/H1Di2cMPock)'s forefathers were, in fact, originally from Corleone, a town in Sicily. All exactly as in the movies. In his youth, he tried his hand as a stand-up comedian.

It seems as if Al Pacino has always been present in cinema, since the dawn of time. In fact, The Godfather is only his second feature. It was preceded by Panic in Needle Park, a gripping drama about drug addicts. Kind of like "Requiem for the Dream," only in 1971.

Both actors, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, have boycotted the Oscar ceremony, where they were nominated for their outstanding work in The Godfather. For a variety of reasons. Brando - for ideological and political reasons. Al Pacino was offended that he was nominated in the supporting actor category, even though, if you clock in with a stopwatch, he got the most on-screen time in ["The Godfather"](https://vano-vhs.com/godfather/).

Like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino has always preferred to play according to Stanislavsky's method.

Al Pacino had as much bad luck as [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/leonardo-dicaprio-facts/). He got plenty of Oscar nominations, with or without any reason. However, he was not awarded the Statuette for 20 years. In the end, he got it for the popular 90's movie "Scent of a Woman". The actor was already 52 years old at that time.

There was a rumor that on the set of "Scarface" Al Pacino was loaded with the real cocaine, which he was served instead of props. And that is why the actor began to have problems with his nose.

Nonetheless, the production team denies these foul slanderous invectives. According to those involved, the white powder role on the set was carried out by dried milk.

The first feature film, where Al Pacino appeared on screen next to Robert De Niro - the [1995 thriller "The Heat"](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/heat-1995-top-facts/). While before that they previously worked together in the "Godfather", but there they have not crossed characters from different timelines.

The funny thing is that many viewers never saw that in ["The Heat"](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/heat-1995-top-facts/) Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were present in the same frame. Rumors started to circulate as if they were filmed apart. Well, there is a scene of them having a meal together. It was only in the wide screen shot that both actors fit into the frame. But for TV and video distribution the frame was always cropped, and one of the two necessarily disappeared.

Al Pacino has never officially married.

At the age of twenty, Al Pacino was arrested and held in a police cell for three days. That is, until it was proven that the gun found in his car - it was a filming prop.
