Problems with the Law, early parenthood and a rap album: 9 facts about Tom Hardy!

**Tough childhood and legal problems**

Hardy grew up a real troublemaker and even in early childhood, adding a lot of gray hair to his parents. For example, when he was 11 years old, the would-be actor tried narcotics for the first time. Because of bad habits of Tom's relationships with loved ones deteriorated, and at age 16, a troubled teenager left the house after being excluded from school for theft. Another year later, armed with a gun, he stole a pre-owned Mercedes-Benz.

In the end of all these misadventures, Tom was arrested, and the aftermath of the crimes committed still echoed in his life for a long time. For example, the aspiring actor had difficulty getting a visa for his first visit to the United States - Tom was allowed to enter only if he wrote a special explanatory note in which he pledged not to break the law and pay taxes.

**Making friends with would-be Hollywood stars and a modeling career**

To enter the acting profession Hardy chose through a back door - modeling. At the age of 19, Tom won a local beauty contest and entered a television project in which the winner would be able to sign a contract with a major modeling agency. Hardy did not become the winner of the show, but he was not too worried about it - the young man was already noticed. Moreover, in addition to the dream of becoming an actor, he put a lot of concrete efforts to achieve this goal: first graduated from drama school in Richmond, and then became a student at the prestigious Drama Centre London.

According to Hardy, Michael Fassbender studied with him on the course, with whom they later became close friends. Fassbender says that teachers of the course considered Hardy the most promising student and had high hopes for him. Benedict Cumberbatch was another close friend, with whom Tom met at the beginning of his career. Together, the actors starred in the small-budget, yet iconic drama "[Stuart: A Life Backwards](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0853153/)".

**The love of tattoos and the hatred of Britain's biggest sport**

Hardy has more than 20 tattoos all over his body (and the number keeps growing). The actor admits that he got his first tattoo when he was 15 - he tattooed a leprechaun as a symbol of his Irish roots. Tom says that each picture on his body is endowed with special sense, the essence of which he refuses to disclose to journalists and fans. But the star's fans were able to see the names of his wife and children, a picture of theatrical masks, the figure of Buddha holding an AK47 assault rifle, and a black crow among Tom's tattoos.

Tom generally enjoys sports and goes to the gym frequently. Among his favorites are jiu-jitsu and kickboxing. But what the actor can't tolerate is soccer. Yes, that's right, the true Englishman does not follow soccer and is not in any way interested in the main sport of his homeland.

**Extraordinary Weight Gain and Outer Transformations**

Hardy belongs to the category of method actors. He builds his work on the role in accordance with the precepts of Konstantin Stanislavsky. Thus, Tom is trying to achieve not only the necessary internal support of his character, but also the maximum external transformation. For the role in the crime drama "Bronson" Tom gained 19 kg of muscle in a tight schedule. Self-experimentation is not an uncommon phenomenon in Hollywood, but it still remains an example of the incredible dedication of actors.

**A failed rap career**

In 1999, the then unknown Hardy tried his hand at the music business. The young actor, who had just recently coped with puberty, decided to express his accumulated aggression in his creative work. So, he recorded the first (and so far the only) mixtape of his own authorship. Those who have heard Hardy's songs confess that the artist's music seems driving and relevant to this day, and Tom has established himself as a rapper with a good technique of reading.

A few years ago, Hardy threatened to continue his musical career and record another rap album, but because of the heavy movie workload he has not managed to reach the recording studio yet.

**Early parenthood and failed marriage**

The first time Hardy got married at the age of 22, but the marriage lasted only 6 years. The actor's second chosen one, with whom he lived in a civil marriage, was Rachel Speed. In this union, Tom's firstborn son Louis was born. Hardy recalls that the birth of a child completely changed his life and forced to be more responsible grown-up.

Even a few years ago, the actor regularly spoiled fans with cute pictures with Louis. Together, father and son made faces at the camera, dressed up in funny Halloween costumes and just spent a lot of time together. Despite the fact that Tom's relationship with Rachel ended in 2009, he continues to be very involved in the life of the heir.

**Unusual introduction to his wife-to-be**

Then, in 2009, Hardy agreed to star in a two-part adaptation of Emily Bronte's classic novel "Wuthering Heights". Tom's on-screen partner was the young actress Charlotte Riley. In the plot, the actors played a tragic love story, but in real life at the first meeting experienced dislike for each other.

Hardy was withdrawn, suffering the separation from the mother of his child, and Riley was afraid of a moody actor who spoke to colleagues through gritted teeth and was not very polite to the crew. That first impression was deceptive, Charlotte learned when Tom unexpectedly asked her out on a date and it turned out that outside of the set he was completely different. In July 2014, the actors got married, and a year later they had their first baby boy. In December 2018, the star family added another child - they had a son.

**Love for Animals and a Touching Farewell to a Pet**

Despite his severe appearance, Tom is a true humanist and is zealous in defending the rights not only of people, but also of animals. So, together with his wife, he saved two dogs from death, which later began to live in the star family. In 2017, the actor's favorite dog, named Woodstock, died of poliomyositis in his sixth year. On his personal blog on Tumbler, Hardy wrote a touching and tenderness-filled obituary in memory of his departed friend.

**Status as one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood**

For Tom, the most titled directors are hunting: the participation of the star in the project guarantees enhanced attention from the audience and the potential success at the box office. The most expensive to date for Hardy was the work in the film "Venom". For shooting in the project, he received $ 7 million, and it is clear that this is not the limit.
