[Sicario](https://youtu.be/E0X0QScOSeE) is a 2015 American action thriller film directed by Denis Villeneuve, written by Taylor Sheridan and starring Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin. Well, [Vano VHS](https://vano-vhs.com/) put together some curious facts that will show the movie from a new perspective!

**Josh Brolin**

For actors, every week counts. Today an actor may be shooting one role in one country, but tomorrow morning he'll be on a plane to another continent to film a few scenes in another flick. Therefore, very seldom it happens that the stars align so that the director brings everyone he wanted to his new movie. Some simply want a vacation after a tough shoot, as was the case with Josh Brolin after "Everest." They offered him one of the leads in S﻿icario, but he got so tired that he declined a collaboration with Denis Villeneuve personally. At that point, Roger Deakins, the movie's cameraman, stepped in, and in a letter to Josh Brolin, he started begging him to join the cast. It was so surprising and impressive to Josh Brolin that he chose to delay his holiday.

**Replicas**

The first approved draft of the script can be completely different from what is portrayed in the movie. Occasionally, the director will make his own changes, the cameraman may also change something for the sake of a better picture, and occasionally an actor who begins to see his character in a different way will have his say. Benicio Del Toro's character is almost always silent and that scares the character of Emily Blunt. So when he finally reveals his true capabilities and motives, she gets even more terrified. Initially, Benicio Del Toro's character was not so mysteriously intimidating. What the actor did before production and during shooting was to cut out nearly all of his lines of dialogue. What was left was only 10% of what was there. Del Toro explained his actions by saying that his character didn't look believable when he was too outspoken.

**The most intense scene**

The shooting was actually done in Mexico, but that iconic scene on the bridge was filmed on a set built from scratch. Several minutes of filming would have taken too long, so they decided to build their own set so they wouldn't have to get permission from the authorities to close the bridge, because that would have taken too much time and would have required a lot of money out of the budget.

**M﻿arvel**

Over the years Marvel Studios has succeeded in bringing in many famous stars. Now a new phase is coming, with even more famous actors in Marvel flicks, and then in a large number of non-Marvel movies, you can count on your fingers how many of the cast have starred in a superhero movie. "Sicario," which was released in 2015, featured five such actors. Josh Brolin played Thanos, Benicio Del Toro played The Collector, Daniel Kaluuya played V'Kabi from Black Panther, Jon Bernthal played The Punisher, and Maximiliano Hernandez was the same Jasper Sitwell, the Hydra agent who handed the case with the tesseract.

**Not as planned**

Towards the end of the film, when Emily Blunt's character walks into a tunnel, she bangs her head. This looked natural in the film, but it was not scripted. The actress actually accidentally bumped her head, but Denis Villeneuve believed that this bit could be left in the movie.

**The film crew was not secure**

No matter how much many travelers praise it, Mexico is a very dangerous place for everyone. The film crew members, who had just come to make a movie, were no exception. Each on the crew was nervous when they arrived in Juarez, and then the excitement took on a particular hue when everyone noticed that stunt coordinator and Army veteran J.J. Perry began to get worried and look around as they pulled into an empty, deserted field.

**The basis of a character**

Actors always find it easier to portray a person when they have an idea of how to play him or her and when they don't have to guess what that person's character might be like. So to play an FBI agent, Emily Blunt interviewed real female FBI agents, who explained to the actress their routines, how they slept and how they unwind. One of the agents even revealed that she watches the TV series "The Office," where Emily Blunt's husband John Krasinski played, after a hard day at work.
