Nick Pizzolatto, the creator of the iconic True Detective series, is about to direct his first feature film, the independent drama "Easy's Waltz".

Vince Vaughn, Michelle Monaghan, [Al Pacino](https://youtu.be/Z3-x70YwDxo), and Simon Rex will star. Pizzolatto also wrote the script.

The plot of the film borrows some storytelling elements from such movies as "Swingers" and "A Star Is Born." The protagonist of the story is a struggling comedian who lives in modern-day Las Vegas, where he interacts with other bizarre Vegas personages.

Pizzolatto created the crime drama starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson on HBO in 2014. Two more seasons were then released, with a fourth season premiering comparatively soon.
