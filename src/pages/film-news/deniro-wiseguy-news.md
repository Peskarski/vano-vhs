The screenplay will be authored by Nicholas Pileggi - yes, the same one who wrote the "Wiseguy" novel, which became the basis for [Goodfellas](https://youtu.be/HqMCro7ih_0).

The story focuses on Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, two crime bosses of Italian-American descent. According to sources, De Niro will play both Genovese and Costello at the same time.
