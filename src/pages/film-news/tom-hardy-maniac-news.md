The series will be based on the 2018 Swedish novel of the same name by Lars Kepler. The plot develops around police officer Saga Bauer, who is on the trail of the notorious serial maniac Jurek Walter (Hardy). He is in a mental institution after committing murders. Undercover, Bauer infiltrates the institution and tries to find out the reasons and circumstances of what happened.

The series will be directed and adapted by Ã˜ystein Karlsen ("Lillehammer"). No release details have been reported.

Hardy recently finished working on the script for "Venom 3," but filming has not yet begun. Before the end of the year, the actor will appear on screens in the action film "Desolation" and the drama "The Bikers."
