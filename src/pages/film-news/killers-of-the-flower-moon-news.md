[Martin Scorsese's](https://youtu.be/bKHTw8TjgI8) "[Killers of the Flower Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5537002/)" tops all 2023 novelty lists. 'Killers of the Flower Moon," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and [Robert De Niro](https://youtu.be/zaxaWzNoBCE), is set in the West in the 1920s. The story is about real-life murders of Native Americans in Oklahoma when it is discovered that their land is located in the oil fields.

Currently the film's running time is three hours and twenty minutes. This is certainly nothing new for Scorsese, but Cannes can't accept such a long movie, so the film festival organizers are asking the Maestro to "squeeze" the film. Let's see what comes of it!
