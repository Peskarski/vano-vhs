The series ["The Devil in the White City,"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959300/) loosely based on the novel of the same title, remains on hold. IndieWire reports that work on the show has been suspended. The Hulu streaming service, on which the series was originally supposed to air, has officially dropped the project.

ABC Signature, the TV division of Walt Disney Television, which owns Hulu, is now looking for another platform for the show. [Martin Scorsese](https://youtu.be/bKHTw8TjgI8) and Leonardo DiCaprio are still credited as executive producers. Initially, both were going to adapt the original source as part of a feature film, but for a variety of reasons they chose to limit themselves to the production. The picture was first handled by Warner Bros. Studios, then Paramount bought the rights. Later, "The Devil in the White City" has changed the format. At that time, the project became interested by the service Hulu, Keanu Reeves and director Todd Field. This was supposed to be a major-budget series, so the streaming service was staking on the star power of Reeves. Last fall, in the midst of preparations for filming, Reeves and Field both left the show. Whatever the reason was, there is still no official version, and insider reports differ on this point. One version is that Reeves agreed to do the series purely because of Field's involvement, but changed his mind when he dropped out. According to another, the director left following the actor, because the announcement of Field's departure came a few days after the news of Reeves' departure.

"The Devil in the White City" is the story of a talented architect, Daniel H. Burnham (he was supposed to be played by Reeves), who sought to leave his mark on history. The second pivotal figure is the mysterious serial killer Dr. Henry Holmes. Their lives are intertwined after a fateful meeting at the World's Fair in Chicago in the late 19th century. Beneath the benevolent personality of Holmes hides a cruel sadist who created the infamous "Castle of Death" - he turned one of the city's hotel complexes into a maze hotel with many torture chambers.
