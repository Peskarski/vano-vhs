Hello, my Goodfellas! "[The Irishman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1302006/)" has become one of the most high-profile film projects of recent times. Based on [real events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa), this crime drama is about the lives of criminals and mobsters in twentieth-century America. Let's dive into history and see how "The Irishman" movie [correlates to reality](https://youtu.be/dqEsLZYQYFk)! Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Everyone knows that labor unions exist and why they are needed. But not many people are aware that unions in some places were not official organizations and were not just about collecting dues and distributing vouchers to health resorts. In the U.S., unions were cohesive and active groups of people who forced employers to honor their rights, both legally and by the use of force. Throughout the history of the labor union movement in the U.S., there was an intrinsic link to the Italian Mafia: with the only non-Italian member being Frank Sheeran, known as "The Irishman".

To be accurate, it should be noted that Frank was never a full member of the Bufalino Mafia family. Yet the fact did not prevent him from being a dear friend and close ally of Don Rosario Alberto Bufalino. Sheeran had committed no less than 30 murders at Russell's request, but none of them were proven.

Frank Sheeran's life journey began in 1920 in an Irish-Swedish family. His father was Irish and his mother was Swedish. Frank grew up in a family where strict morals were valued. Frank's father was a skilled boxer and boxing was part of his upbringing: for every offense his father would throw Frank boxing gloves and arrange a sparring session with him. It was an unusual sparring, however, for the rules prohibited Frank from retaliating, but the father was at liberty to punish his son with punches for his faults.

Frank Sheeran's life journey began in 1920. A son to an Irish father and Swedish Mother. Frank grew up in a family where strict morals were valued. Frank's father was a skilled boxer and boxing was part of his upbringing: for every offense his father would throw Frank boxing gloves and arrange a sparring session with him. It was an unusual sparring, however, for the rules prohibited Frank from retaliating, but the father was at liberty to punish his son with punches for his faults.

Frank Sheeran, who inherited his height and robust physique from his Scandinavian ancestors on his mother's side, reached the height of two meters at the age of 15. Frank's father had to cut his temper in home fights, as Frank began to give him a serious push back. In spite of his powerful physique, Frank showed no interest in physical labor, and his first adult job was at the local church.

Strong and broad-shouldered, Frank got a job as a servant in a church and performed his duties with integrity until he sensed an inherited tendency toward alcohol. One day, after another service, Frank decided to sip some church wine, but inadvertently drank the entire month's supply. Certainly after that, he couldn't continue working and lost his position.

Frank Sheeran's upbringing ended at age 17, when he realized his incredible strength. That day his high school principal called him into the office to berate him for a violation, but as Frank entered the office, the principal smacked him with a slap on the wrist. In retaliation, Frank broke the principal's jaw in one punch. When he returned home, his furious father threw him boxing gloves again, but Frank declared that he would not wear them again.

As a 21-year-old in 1941, Frank Sheeran tried various part-time jobs and then volunteered for the war, where he remained until his demobilization in 1945. During the war he spent 411 days in combat, compared to the standard of 80, and demonstrated a particular cold-bloodedness toward the enemy. Charles Brandt, author of "I Heard You Paint Houses," states that it was harder to get the war memories out of Frank than it was to get a confession to the killing of Jimmy Hoffa.

Frank Sheeran explained to Charles Brandt that he had learned not to befriend anyone who got in his way. He learned that if you befriended someone, that person could be killed. For example, a 19-year-old young man could join their unit and then die. It was very hard damaging to manâ€™s mental state

Frank Sheeran fought in the Ardennes, Sicily, and France, where he proved unparalleled courage, but was also known for his not always justified ruthlessness. He often volunteered on firing squads and showed no mercy to captives of war. On several occasions he was credited with the unauthorized murders of concentration camp guards, but always escaped punishment.

Toward the end of the war, Frank had many honors, but his actions had become infamous and many of his fellow soldiers shunned him. As an old man, he confessed that being able to kill with impunity during the war determined the rest of his life. He was used to death and having to kill other people.

Upon his return from the war, Frank Sheeran attempts many different jobs, but is unable to stay anywhere for long. He also suffers from PTSD and is unable to get over what happened in Europe. His mother tries to help by using her connections to get Frank hired by the police, but Fate has other plans.

Sheeran married Mary Leddy, an Irishwoman in 1946, after they met at a boxing match where Frank was up against a kangaroo. They had three daughters in their first marriage before divorcing in 1968. In his  second marriage to Irene Gray in 1968, Frank would have another daughter, named Connie. Altogether, Sheeran had four daughters from two marriages.

Frank was employed to drive a truck that delivered meat to restaurants. He had been working for this company for more than 10 years and had an extra income. First, he steals products and sells them at a lower price. Second, he works as a debt collector and helps pay back problem loans to loan sharks, such as Skinny Razor, the owner of one of the restaurants where Sheeran supplies meat. One day, however, he goes overboard and steals all the products. Sheeran is accused of the theft, but they can't show proof.

The investigation demands that he give up his accomplices, but he refuses and warns witnesses not to testify against him. In the end, the court closes the case for lack of evidence. After Sheeran's case was closed in court, relations with the company's management were permanently damaged, and he was offered to resign.

Sheeran agreed on the condition that he would be compensated $25,000. Frank continued to work for the company despite this, but management hired a private investigator to keep an eye on him. Eventually, one of Sheeran's associates was caught stealing: Frank agrees to quit if his colleague's case is not taken to court.

He is invited by Skinny Razor  to a celebration at the restaurant, where he meets Russell Buffalino(buff-a-lino. It turns out that they have met before: Buffalino, an older Italian, helped Sheeran repair a truck when it stalled on the road, but he did not introduce himself.

Russell Buffalino was the head of the Buffalino family and one of the most powerful Mafia bosses, one whose opinion mattered to other Mafia bosses in the United States. He was so influential that, according to one version, the CIA could have used his services in planning the assassination of Fidel Castro.

Some time passes, and Russell Buffalino finds Sheeran to thank him for not rattling on his associate to the cops. Russell thinks Frank did the right thing, as friends should help each other and stand up for each other. Over time, Russell and Frank become good friends, and their families begin to bond as well. They have common memories of Sicily: Russell was born in Catania and Sheeran fought there. Frank also learned Italian during the war, which helps him better understand and connect with Russell.

Frank begins hanging out with Russell and doing various errands for him. Usually Russell would ask him to send someone to Australia, and Sheeran would do these tasks pro bono. However, he knew that if he helped the Buffalino family, he would also get help if necessary. And it happened several times: Russell Buffalino repeatedly stood up for Frank in front of his "older comrades" when he found himself in trouble.

Sheeran one day accepts a job to burn down a laundromat, unaware that a close friend of Russell's, Bruno Angelo, owns a share in the business. When Frank is spotted at the laundromat, he is invited to meet Angelo and Russell. Figuring out what he's gotten himself into, Sheeran is left with no choice but to assassinate "The Whisperer," the mastermind behind the arson that led to Sheeran misstep.

Later, Russell introduces Frank to Jimmy Hoffa, the leader of the truckers' union. The first words Jimmy spoke to Sheeran were, "I heard you paint houses?" I heard you kill people. Sheeran replied, "I can do carpentry as well" - I can make a coffin and dispose of a body. Hoffa quickly became friends with Sheeran and made him head of one of the union branches.

Jimmy Hoffa was  one of the most colorful and controversial figures in 20th-century America. He started his career as a member of the truckers' union in Detroit, and later developed it into one of the largest trade union movements in the United States. He greatly expanded the geography of the union, increasing the number of its branches in different states, and through his negotiating skills he got better conditions for unionized workers.

Yet the number of allegations of corruption against the truckers' union grows, and rumors start to spread that the Mafia is using the union as a front for drug trafficking. This led to the creation of a Senate committee to investigate the unions headed by Robert Kennedy, the younger brother of the future President. The standoff between Hoffa and Kennedy lasted more than 10 years, but at the time Hoffa managed to avoid prison. Following an investigation, union president David Bake was arrested. He was found guilty of racketeering and misappropriation of union money. This gave Jimmy the opportunity to take over his seat.

By 1960, John F. Kennedy became president of the United States. He soon appoints his brother Robert as Attorney General. Robert Kennedy was eager to repay his debt and made Jimmy Hoffa a target. He established a special unit to investigate the union and Jimmy Hoffa in person.

In November 1963, John F. Kennedy was killed, and Jimmy Hoffa could not hide his joy. While all of America was lowering flags in shock, Hoffa ordered the flag to be raised as a sign of his victory. Moreover, he fired the employee who dared to lower the flag.

Ultimately, the criminal charges against Jimmy Hoffa came to their logical end. In 1964, the Court sentenced Hoffa to 15 years in prison. However, he did not begin serving his sentence until 1967, after he lost his appeal. Even so, Hoffa didn't have to serve his full term because Nixon granted him a pardon: with one proviso, that Hoffa would not be able to hold any union positions during the period set by the court.

Hoffa was displeased with the prohibition and sought to appeal it by suing the White House, but failed to win support. In addition, Hoffa faced another problem: he was no longer welcome in the union. The union leadership and the underworld were happy with the status quo. Hoffa returned to Detroit to start afresh in union life.

On July 30, 1975, Jimmy Hoffa disappeared under mysterious circumstances. He was last seen in the parking lot of an establishment in a Detroit neighborhood. Hoffa called his wife and told her he had been screwed, and according to his wife, he was extremely nervous. After that, nobody ever saw him again.

An eyewitness said he saw Hoffa in the backseat of a maroon Mercury leaving the parking lot with another passenger. The car's owner stated that he had loaned the car to Chuckie O'Brien that day, whom Hoffa regarded as his son. Although O'Brien did not deny that he had been driving the Mercury that day, he claimed that he had not seen Hoffa. However, a dog smelled Hoffa in the back seat and in the trunk.

Just before his death, Frank Sheeran confessed to Charles Brandt that he had killed Jimmy Hoffa. Sheeran was considered by Hoffa to be a member of his family and he trusted him wholeheartedly. Hoffa's son, James, agreed with this version and stated that his father would only have gotten into the car with Sheeran. Frank claimed he drove Hoffa to a house on the outskirts of Detroit and killed him with two shots to the back of the head. In 2003, Frank Sheeran died in a nursing home in Philadelphia. His confession was captured on video.
