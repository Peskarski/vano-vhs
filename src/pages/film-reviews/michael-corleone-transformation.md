Hello my Goodfellas! [](https://youtu.be/E0X0QScOSeE)The Godfather's [Michael Corleone](https://youtu.be/Z3-x70YwDxo) transforms from a bright hopeful student into a stone-cold, ruthless Mafia leader. But what makes Michael Corleone change, and when exactly does the [transformation](https://youtu.be/Z3-x70YwDxo) happen? My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Michael was Don Vito's favourite, even though he was by no means the easiest fellow: Michael had decided, as a young man, to keep out of the dealings of the Corleone family. And generally, he sought to make himself as Americanized as he possibly could, trying to break with Italian traditions.

For example, when the war begins, Michael immediately joins the volunteers, which naturally enrages Sonny and grieves Don Corleone. Remember, Vito could have easily gotten his son out of the service with his contacts, but Michael does everything in secret, deliberately keeping his father unaware. Moving on! The younger Corleone develops a relationship with Kay Adams, who was the true epitome of all things American. Michael even gets an education by going to university. And, of course, we should remember the scene at Connie Corleone's wedding, where we first meet Michael and his future wife.

So let's pay attention to what Michael is wearing. All correct, he is sitting at the table in his military dress uniform. We might think that this seems like nothing unusual, but it's not: imagine coming to your brother's or sister's wedding in a cop's uniform, being a cop for a living. Especially, as we remember from the book, Connie and Carlo celebrated the wedding in the traditional Italian style, because Don Vito had insisted on it. Michael wore a military uniform on purpose, intending to underscore the rebellion against his roots.

We all remember, of course, when Michael's wife-to-be asked who Luca Brasi was. In response to her question, Michael recounted a creepy story about Luca, Vito, Johnny Fontaine, and a non-compliant producer. We all remember it, I don't see the point in re-telling it for the 100th time. Anyway, the story Michael told had a lasting impression on Kay. Then Michael abruptly added: that's my family, Kay, that's not me. Michael draws a clear line between himself and the Corleone family.

But, as they say, fate doesn't care about your plans! And so it goes for Michael: just as his life with Kay began to go uphill, his father, Vito Corleone, is shot by unknown: Don miraculously survives and is on the edge of life and death. Michael discovers the misfortune from Kay, who accidentally notices a newspaper headline while on a walk. Upon learning of the emergency, Michael immediately follows to the nearest phone booth and calls Santino. What's interesting about this scene is that Michael closes the door behind him and stays indoors, while Kay is unable to hear what Michael is talking to his brother about. You could say that Michael is slowly starting his transformation. Even more interesting, a very similar scene awaits us in the finale of the first film, but first things first!

The changes inside Michael begin when he comes to visit his wounded father in the hospital. To Michael's dismay, no one guards his father's room, Vito is now an easy target for the enemy. The younger Corleone is fully aware that his family needs him now more than ever: Fredo is a sissy, Tom almost died at the hands of Sollozzo, and Sonny is a hothead capable of making hurried decisions. There is an interesting shot in the hospital scene where we get a close-up view of Michael's face: half of his face is visible and half is not. You could say that Michael is on a crossroads: yes, he has decided to help his family, but he hasn't become a criminal yet, he still has a chance to live an honest citizen's life.

Why was Michael so important to Corleone's victory? It was simple: he was Don Vito's son, he could negotiate on his behalf, and, most importantly, Sollozzo underestimated Michael, thought he was weak and saw him as no threat: even the corrupt cop McCluskey wasn't afraid to punch Michael in the face. Would he dare do the same thing to Santino? I highly doubt it! If he'd allowed himself that luxury, they'd have found him the next day in a ditch. Sonny is a man of honour, a wise man, raising your hand to a wise guy is a death sentence. Yes, Sollozzo misjudged Michael, and that played a bad trick on him. After all, none other than Michael would soon devise a scheme to eliminate Sollozzo and McCluskey in one fell swoop. The Youngest Corleone knew exactly what he was getting into: okay, killing a Mafioso, but killing a police captain was no joke. The Mafia had always had a point when it came to killing law-enforcers. It's worth pointing out that Michael wasn't initially entrusted with such an important and risky mission; many within the family, including Santino, doubted his abilities.

After killing the Turk and the dirty cop, Michael completely engaged himself in the underworld; he simply had no way back. Yes, murder is certainly a terrible thing to do, but Michael himself at that He had already dealt with the enemy at the front, so it hardly shattered his idea of morality. Nothing personal - just business, as they say. But the flipside of the coin was the need to go on the run, since not only the rival families were now after his head, but also every police officer wishing to avenge the death of the police captain - Michael was compelled to go into hiding in Sicily.

We should not forget that captain Michael Corleone served in the Marines. There he earned many medals for bravery in fighting the enemy. I suppose the War left a negative as well as a positive imprint on him simultaneously. While at the front, Michael trained himself to be a strategist, to cooperate with his fellows, and to fight the enemy. I daresay, as I am familiar with the stories of Frank Sheeran, best known to us as "The Irishman": in his memoirs, Sheeran emphasized in great detail his military background and how World War II affected him. If you haven't read it, be sure to do so: with all due respect to Scorsese, I think this book gives his film a head start.

While in Sicily visiting Don Tommasino, Michael encounters the young Apollonia and becomes madly in love. Eventually Michael has a small hope of one day returning to his homeland, starting a family, having children, and living the American dream. Vito recovered, Sonny could and would be the next don, the War of the Five Families was coming to an end. But then fate plays a mean trick on Michael again - the youngest Corleone is about to have a very dark streak in his life. Carlo Rizzi betrays Santino, after which he is shot to death. At the same time, Barzini manages to buy off one of Michael's guards, Fabrizio, who, in an attempt to kill Michael, takes the life of his wife, who at the time was carrying his child.

This particular event was Michael's point of no return. He had never thought about it before, but Now he couldn't get the question out of his head: if enemies can so easily take the lives of my beloved ones, how could I keep myself and my family safe and never have to experience such events ever again. Now he has to learn to think and behave like his enemies. Upon his return to America, you might say Michael had no choice but to become the Boss of the family. This is not shown in the film, but the book stresses this point: Michael didn't immediately go to meet Kay Adams, it wasn't until 18 months later that he paid her a visit.

In Michael and Kay's reunion scene, we see a totally new Michael. The way I see it, the marriage proposal is a calculated move by Michael, part of his strategy to legitimize the family business, so to speak. Michael's face in this scene doesn't really exude any emotion. But why does he want Kay in particular? Because she knows and trusts the Michael who no longer exists. Michael thinks that she will be a good wife and mother to his children; moreover, she is loyal to him. The new Don will need a family to make him look good in the eyes of people: for example, in the newspapers or on television, or during an election campaign, for example. Let's keep in mind that Michael's ultimate goal was to become a legitimate businessman or politician.

Try to look at Michael's actions as a game of chess: as soon as Vito hands his son his powers, Michael instantly goes to Vegas to straighten things out with Moe Greene. Later, all the enemies posing a threat to the Corleone family are wiped out in one fell swoop: the other family bosses, Moe Greene, Tessio, Carlo Rizzi. Michael no longer cares about anyone's death, he takes lives on in a heartbeat. I agree, Michael needed to get even with his enemies at that point, but think back to what this policy leads to in the second film? Michael takes the life of his own brother.

And the finale of the movie, of course, deserves special attention. Remember how Michael shut the door in front of Kay at the beginning of the movie, while in the phone booth? He's once again closing the door to his complicated world, now completely. And then, when a loved one, his wife, asks if Michael was involved in the murder of his sister's husband, Michael lies to her and answers no, thus putting a fat end to his transformation from being a human being to a stone-cold killer.
