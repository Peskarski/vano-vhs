Hello my Goodfellas! Was [Lefty Ruggiero](https://youtu.be/jVh_Y9nFm4o) killed at the end of the Donnie Brasco movie? Indeed, this is a great question, and it implies two very different answers, and today we will be answering them, taking into account both the film and the novel “Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia”. Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Now we need to clarify who Lefty was. [Benjamin Ruggiero](https://youtu.be/jVh_Y9nFm4o), also known as "Lefty", "Lefty Guns" and "Lefty Two Guns" played by [Al Pacino](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/al-pacino-facts/) was a member of the Bonanno crime family. He is well known for his friendship and mentorship of FBI undercover agent Joseph D. Pistone aka “Donnie Brasco”. Ruggiero earned his nickname "Lefty" because he tossed dice with his left hand while playing craps. Also, Ruggiero earned the nickname "Two Guns" because he preferred to take two guns when he went on a hit. Now that we know briefly who he was, it's time to answer the central question: [was Lefty killed at the end of the movie](https://youtu.be/jVh_Y9nFm4o)?

As we recall, in the film the FBI chooses to stop the operation. Donnie Brasco, knowing that in this scenario, "Lefty" would be killed by the mob, is prepared to offer him the hidden money so that Lefty can escape. Following their arrest, the two are released, and an FBI representative tells "Sonny Black" and "Lefty" that Donnie is an operative of the FBI. That evening, a telephone rings in "Lefty's" place; he is "summoned." Knowing that he will be murdered for bringing a "rat" in the organization, Lefty goes away, dropping off his valuables and money at his house.

In the movie, when the FBI agent slides a picture of Lefty down on the "Mafia family tree," having previously learned that Sonny Black had been murdered, he sticks a pin in Lefty’s head, letting us know that he will soon be finished off.

So yes, we can certainly tell that in the movie, Lefty went to feed the worms or to Luca Brasi. I think many of us remember the touching line that Lefty said at the end of the movie: *And listen to me, if Donnie calls... , tell him... if it was gonna be anyone, I'm glad it was him. All right?*

And this amazing line leads us to the real story behind the movie “Donnie Brasco”! The point is that those lines actually belonged to Sonny Black, not [Lefty](https://youtu.be/jVh_Y9nFm4o). Sonny Black and Donnie had become very close at some point: Donnie had lived with Sonny for a long time, and they even did weightlifting together - both Sonny and Donnie were well built and strong for their age.

So when Sonny and the crew realized that Donnie was a rat, they instantly understood that all of them would be whacked - it wasn’t a question, it was a matter of time. The FBI was also interested in making the mobsters cooperate with the investigation, so they immediately proposed Sonny a deal: Sonny was offered a warm place in the witness protection program. But Sonny was old-school so he refused the deal and preferred to face the consequences.

It was August 1981, when Napolitano aka “Sonny Black” was invited to a meeting in the basement of a house in Brooklyn. Anticipating that he would be executed, Napolitano gave his jewelry to a favorite bartender who worked under his apartment, as well as the keys to the house. Bonanno's capos drove Napolitano to the place. Napolitano was pushed down the ladder into the basement and shot. When the first shot failed, Sonny Black told them, "Shoot me again and do it right”.

Sonny's girlfriend later reached out to Pistone and told him that shortly before Sonny died, Napolitano told her that he felt no malice toward Pistone because he knew that Pistone was only doing his job, and that if anyone was responsible for his demise, he was happy that it was Donnie. She said that Napolitano really loved Brasco and was grieved when he found out that he was an agent.

In August 1982, a body was found; the corpse had severed hands and a face so badly decomposed that dental records were needed to determine identity. The FBI announced that it had discovered Napolitano's corpse. Sonny Black's hands were separated from his body as a warning to other Mafia members to follow the rules about proper introductions.

**And what about Lefty Two Guns? Did he survive? Was he killed as well?**

After the Bonanno bosses learned the truth, they immediately went after the men who brought Brasco into their midst. Mirra and Napolitano were murdered shortly afterwards. The operations officers found out that Lefty was next in line to be sent to the other world. So, on August 13th, Ruggiero's car was stopped. FBI agents took Lefty into custody on a number of charges.

Immediately after his arrest, [Ruggiero](https://youtu.be/jVh_Y9nFm4o) was taken into protective custody, and agents pressured him to enroll in the Witness Protection Program. Ruggiero, however, took the case seriously by taking an oath of silence.

Lefty, along with other mobsters, were found guilty and were given a 15-year prison term. Ruggiero refused to believe that Donnie Brasco was an FBI agent and not his sidekick. “Two Guns” even once said to his defense attorney, "Donnie would never go against us." Yet after Pistone testified against him, he later stated: "I'll get that bastard Donnie if it's the last thing I do."

Suffering from cancer, Ruggiero was eventually released from imprisonment in 1993 after serving a sentence of nearly 11 years. He died on November 24, 1994.
