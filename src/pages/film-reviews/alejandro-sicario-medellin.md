Hello my Goodfellas! In [Sicario](https://youtu.be/e-CMmBB9-GE), why is Alejandro referred to as Medellín by the Mexicans? This is a very good question that needs attention. Personally, it took me watching Sicario at least three times to work out the question. Now I'll help you figure out what's going on, and what does [Medellin](https://youtu.be/e-CMmBB9-GE) have to do with anything? Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

Yes, [Alejandro](https://youtu.be/E0X0QScOSeE) really was once a prosecutor, but after losing his family, he lost all hope and decided at all costs to take revenge on the killers. Now let's remember - who is behind the death of Alejandro's family? That's right - Fausto Alarcón. Then let us ask ourselves - who is this Alarcón? Fausto Alarcón was a drug lord in the Sonora Cartel. The Sonora Cartel was a Mexico based criminal cartel.

At the very beginning of the film we saw a scene where the heroine of Emily Blunt, together with a special group, discovers a house with dozens of corpses stored in its walls. These people died at the hands of said cartel.

Long before the Mexican cartels emerged, none other than Pablo Escobar founded the successful Medellin cartel, which, one might say, had a monopoly on the cocaine trade worldwide. The cartel operated from 1967 to 1993 in America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania.

At its height, the Medellín Cartel was the largest drug cartel in the world and smuggled three times as much cocaine as their main competitor, the Cali Cartel, an international drug-trafficking organization based in Colombia.

Traditionally, Pablo and the Medellín Cartel had an arrangement with the Cali Cartel that resulted in Medellín controlling the cocaine trade in Miami, and Cali controlling New York City, while both of them agreed to share Los Angeles and Houston.

Naturally, by the time of the film's events the entire cocaine monopoly is in the hands of the Mexican cartels, and the former glory of Medellín is gone. So what's the problem? And to answer that, we can use Josh Brolin's character:

> Medellin refers to a time when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade, providing a measure of order that we could control. And until somebody finds a way to convince 20% of the population to stop snorting and smoking that shit, order's the best we can hope for. And what you saw up there was Alejandro working toward returning that order.

Do you think that can't happen? Would you say it's a fairy tail? Then let's remember the famous TV series "Narcos", or to be more precise, one minor but very colorful character, Bill Stechner, formerly known as Mr. Green. He was a CIA operative who provided weaponry to numerous rebel factions worldwide, notably in Latin America. He was assigned to head a CIA station in Colombia in 1992.

The basis for Bill Stechner was Felix Ismael Rodriguez: a retired C.I.A. agent who provided weaponry to the Nicaraguan contras, and as a counterpart Felix delivered drugs from Mexico to the United States, using American military flights that did not require U.S. customs control and the cocaine was both safe and clean for selling in the States, the same role as Stechner had in "Narco: Mexico.” Felix was also involved in many CIA "operations'' in Latin America, as was Bill's character in the "Narcos" and "Narcos: Mexico".

In the series, after Escobar's murder, Steckner agreed to agent Peña's return to Colombia. Representatives of the Cali cartel were negotiating a surrender deal with the government at the time, with the deal approved by the U.S. State Department. Steckner wanted Peña back to secure the legitimacy of the surrender deal and warned him not to hunt down the Cali cartel. Simply put, the government made the Cali cartel the only major cocaine smuggler, and the Medellín cartel was on the sidelines.

So, as we can see, the film's script is not some detached from reality stories, but quite real events that take place behind our backs on a daily basis. The special services are playing their own game: they choose winners and losers, or to be more precise, those with whom it is easier to deal and control. In fact, you'll find an entire article on Wikipedia devoted to allegations of CIA drug trafficking. When you finish watching this video, I recommend you check it out.

No one knows how many years this operation had been in the planning stages. We cannot rule out the possibility that the events in Sicario are the outcome of years of effort, which began while Medellín was still running its operations. I have several quite viable theories on this subject.

**We should not forget that Alejandro was really once a prosecutor:** let’s recollect the scene outside the torture room, when Alejandro exchanges a few lines with a colleague who knows him from his former position and life. While serving as a prosecutor, Alejandro seriously stepped on the toes of cartel members, which eventually led to the deaths of his wife and daughter. I believe his face was often on television in those days, and many members of the underworld knew the prosecutor by sight.

The scene in which [Alejandro](https://youtu.be/E0X0QScOSeE) talks to Guillermo in the torture room works well to support this theory. As we recall, Guillermo scoffs that he doesn't understand English before Alejandro invites him to take a walk in Yankee country. As we gather from the reaction, the drug lord's brother didn't fully understand what Alejandro was capable of. So he knows him from his former life as a prosecutor.

**Moving on to theory number two.** Matt tells Kate that Alejandro worked for the Medellin Cartel before he took the CIA's training course. Here, it seems to me, there are two possibilities as to how events led Alejandro to where he is now. Option number one: Alejandro, as a prosecutor, represented the interests of the Medellín cartel, which was contrary to the interests of the Mexicans. As we recall, in "Sicario, Part 2," Gillick kills a high-ranking Matamoros cartel lawyer in Mexico City, and before killing him, he removes his mask so that the rival lawyer knows who his killer really is. Cartels have enormous influence in those places: Corruption is deeply entrenched in all spheres of influence, including the executive branch. So I don't think such a scenario can be ruled out.

The second version is: Alejandro is an assassin working for a Colombian cartel. After the terrible deaths of his wife and daughter, Alejandro has no desire to go somewhere quiet, forget about everything and start his life over again. Instead, he gathers all his hatred into a fist and turns to the Medellin cartel for help. Indeed, to set in motion a plan of revenge against the powerful Mexican cartel, hands alone will not be enough. My guess is that the Colombians taught Alejandro the basics of weapons, tactics, and so forth. Then, at some point, he is spotted by CIA operatives, who take him under their wing and decide to use his anger to their advantage. They convince him that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and by helping them, he can accomplish his plan of revenge.

**And here's theory number three**. While making this video, I also came across some interesting thoughts about Alejandro becoming a kind of a legend among the cartel members. Considering that after the murder of his relatives he became so unrelenting in killing anyone involved in the murder of his family, people thought it undesirable and even dangerous to mention him openly. He became a kind of boogeyman, a scary fairy tale in the eyes of Mexicans, if you will.

It is not a surprise, because for Alejandro the end always justifies the means, and he will make whatever sacrifices to achieve his goal. This aspect is perfectly shown in the scene when Alejandro gets the information in the interrogation room, as well as in the scene that appears only in the draft version of the movie script. All this will be discussed in detail in my next video, so subscribe to the channel, leave comments down and stay tuned!
