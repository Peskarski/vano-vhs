Hello, my Goodfellas! Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and [Martin Scorsese](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJE-RJqUo77QVbJ3pWwt3YioOrJXc8Fb) again delighted the audience with their newest project - the crime drama ["Killers of the Flower Moon"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5537002/). The movie screenplay is based on the [bestselling book](https://www.davidgrann.com/book/killers-of-the-flower-moon/), which, in turn, is based on true events, which made the blood run cold in your veins - let’s break it down! Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

In the twenties, the people of the Osage Indian tribe in Oklahoma, USA, were the richest in the world in proportion to their population. They built luxurious mansions, drove cars, and sent their children to Europe to study. However, their story became one of tragedy when their land was discovered to contain oil. The Indian land rights treaty with the U.S. government did not give them unlimited property rights, although it was more favorable than treaties with other tribes.

In 1921 Congress passed a law requiring the appointment of trustees for each Osage, who would manage their financial affairs until they showed competence. Even minors with less than half Osage blood were assigned trustees, regardless of the presence of living parents. Trustees were appointed from  local white lawyers and businessmen who, with incentives for crime, frequently resorted to legal machinations to steal land, property rights, and fees from the Osages. Some trustees were even suspected of murdering their wards in order to gain property rights.

The time had come for William Hale and his cohorts. Not much is known about Hale's early life except that he was born in Greenville, Texas. Apparently he came to the Osage Indian Reservation shortly before the turn of the twentieth century.

In Osage County, it has become dangerous to own land on which oil springs are located. Previously Hale had appropriated the property of dead people, but now he began to take care to ensure that his victims would die "in time’’  . Many Indians died in mysterious ways, sometimes with a bullet in their heads, sometimes by " unfortunate accidents," such as being crushed by blocks of rock, as if the rocks themselves had appeared out of nowhere. Some died of convulsions, right after drinking whiskey. In all the cases, Hale profited. From hefty life insurance, from counterfeit promissory notes that were easily accepted by the courts, or from suspiciously drafted letters of land ownership that often appeared on the eve of the Indians' demise. Although there were many cases of murder, none were investigated.

The events in Osage County did not concern the Oklahoma State Police at all. Furthermore, Hale always had an airtight alibi, as he did not kill anyone himself but rather prudently stayed in the shadows, controlling the actions of his hired guns from behind the scenes. If someone did not obey or tried to talk, they themselves would be sent to their ancestors in a few hours. Although each crime individually did not bring in a large income, in aggregate they gave Hale a considerable profit. In 1920, he left Osage and returned to his ranch. The land he had acquired by then amounted to twenty thousand hectares, complemented by herds of cattle and valuable horse breeds. In Fairfax, Hale acquired half the shares of one bank, a large trading center, and a funeral home, so he could even do business on burying his victims. Since then, he has been called the "King of the Osage Hills."

However, the newly minted banker was not satisfied with what he had achieved, and the series of murders continued. When several Native Americans asked a lawyer to start proceedings against Hale, the lawyer unexpectedly "fell off" a speeding train. Hale provided him with luxurious funerals. Now no lawyer would take on a case if their client was an Osage Indian. Local authorities also did nothing. Meanwhile, the banker-murderer was preparing a deal that was supposed to bring him over three hundred thousand dollars.

This was approximately the value of the property of an elderly Native American woman named Lizzie Qiros. She had oil shares and unprecedented wealth by Indian standards. She had three daughters: Rita Smith, who was married to a white man, Anna Brown, whose husband died in an accident (an exception without Hale's help), and finally, Molly - the youngest unmarried girl.

Banker Hale began his new venture by "setting up" his nephew, Ernest Burkhart, with Molly. The young man succeeded in his mission and soon married Molly. Happy Uncle William provided money for the wedding, which took place in April 1921. Soon after, Anna Brown disappeared mysteriously. A month later, her body, already badly decomposed with a bullet in the skull, was found in a canyon near Fairfax. A few weeks later, Lizzie also passed away.

Rumors began to spread that her death had been hastened by some poisonous substance. In order to calm things down, Hale decided to wait, and only in early 1923 ordered a new murder to be committed. On the morning of February 6th, a shot shattered the morning silence, and Molly and Rita's cousin fell headfirst on the steering wheel of his Ford. The out-of-control car hit a lamppost, overturned, rolled down a slope, and exploded, engulfed in flames. The Oklahoma authorities did not react to this incident.

Soon after, Molly fell ill, and it was later discovered that she had been poisoned, but she recovered when she left. After that, she divorced Ernest, and their children inherited Molly's estate.

A month later, Hale went to the annual cattle fair in Texas. When he returned, Fairfax was gripped with horror and panic, which he learned about at the train station. At three o'clock in the morning, a powerful explosion shook the city, and a whole house was blown into the air. Hale immediately ordered himself to be taken to his friend, the sheriff, where he received pleasant news: the cause of the explosion could not be determined because there were no traces left, and the owners of the house were torn to pieces. These owners were Bill and Rita Smith, who had recently lived on the reservation. Smith and his Native American wife had moved to town at Hale's urging.

That same evening, an unwelcome guest came to the "king of the Osage hills." It was a heavily drunk Ace Kirby, a lumpen who had already carried out delicate assignments for the banker-criminal on more than one occasion. Hale asked sharply:

> *\- Didn't I tell you not to come to me without a call? What's going on?*
>
> *\- It's all right, boss, nobody saw me.*
>
> *\- I told you not to drink here in town. Just tell me what you want.*
>
> *\- Don't worry about it, boss. It wasn't more than half a pint. I only played a little at the Town Saloon. Failed, though. Now I'm broke. Can I...*

Hale went through his desk.

> *\- There's twenty dollars here. Don't say anything more about the fireworks. I had nothing to do with it!*
>
> *Then he pondered for a few minutes.*
>
> *\- Kirby, I'll give you one more piece of advice before you leave town. I'll tell you one thing alone. You can become a rich man, but you must promise me to disappear not only from Fairfax, but from Oklahoma. Somewhere else you can start your crazy life all over again.*

Kirby didn't need time to think about it.

> *\- All right, if the business is lucrative, then Acy will vanish from the horizon.*
>
> *\- Do you know the Lincoln Pharmacy on Mayne Street? The diamond collection will be there for two more days. Lincoln's brother brought it in four days ago and will pick it up again. The jewels will give you thirty thousand dollars. You must burglarize the shop next night. It's not dangerous, Lincoln doesn't live in a drugstore. I saved it for you because you deserve it. But before you get drunk in town, you'd better get out of here for good. When brandy unleashes your tongue, it's dangerous for us all.*

In high spirits, Acy Kirby faded into the darkness.

The next morning, Hale was strolling along Main Street. Finally, he went into Lincoln's pharmacy. There, he told them that late yesterday evening, he was inspecting the remains of the blown-up house and heard a few snippets of a conversation from a passing car. The conversation was apparently about Lincoln's pharmacy and a spectacular fireworks display. He didn't see any connection until it dawned on him this morning. The criminals were obviously in the car, and the words could have referred to the pharmacy. He decided to warn them so that the owners could prepare a "warm" reception for the boys.

Lincoln and his assistant decided to spend the upcoming night in the pharmacy. The owner prepared a submachine gun, and both of them sat in the dark, waiting. Six hours passed, when the back door's window was smashed, and a hand cautiously reached inside the room. The figure's outlines were visible against the night sky; Lincoln silently positioned the gun in a convenient position... and only took his hand off the trigger when the magazine emptied.

When silence fell behind the pharmacy door, the light flashed on. In pools of blood lay Ace Kirby, riddled with more than twenty bullets. Now he was no longer a danger to banker Hale. But, anticipating the joy of a big catch, Kirby had blabbed to several accomplices the night before the fatal raid on the pharmacy.

The next "blunder" was obvious: the Native Americans were by no means indifferent to the crimes committed against their fellow tribesmen. They sent complaints to all possible authorities, including the governor of Oklahoma, asking for protection. Gradually, everyone understood that the "king of the Osage hills" was benefiting from all these murders. After the explosion in Fairfax, a tribal council was held. The elders drew up a petition to the Minister of the Interior in Washington.

![](/img/irishman-the-true-story.00_06_21_06.still007.png)

The petition stated, "Since many members of our tribe have been killed, and other crimes have been committed against them, we have decided to ask the Minister of the Interior to order the department to capture and bring to justice the killers of our tribe." This was followed by a detailed list of unsolved murders and crimes that resulted in many Native Americans losing their property. In April 1923, the letter from the Native Americans landed on the desk of the Minister of the Interior.

The new Minister of the Interior carefully tried to stay away from such scandals. In particular, he paid close attention to the petition from the council of Native Americans, especially since it concerned Oklahoma, and therefore, oil. Since the issues raised in the petition fell within the FBI's jurisdiction, the minister ordered several agents to be sent to Oklahoma.

In the summer of 1923, four people settled in Fairfax one after another: a cattle trader, an oil exploration geologist, an insurance agent, and a herbalist doctor. They were special FBI agents who held secret meetings and consultations: no one was supposed to know about their presence in the town or their mission.

Initially, they began investigating a series of murders within the Lizzie Quiros family, and soon they were able to discover and identify the body of Native American Henry Running Horse. In other cases, the bodies could not be identified, so further investigation was not pursued. Thus, formal grounds for the murders of Anna Brown, Lizzie Quiros, Bill and Rita Smith were not investigated. However, what was connected with the death of Henry Running Horse provided enough evidence. Shortly before the murder of this Native American, his life was insured for twenty five thousand dollars in favor of William Hale.

![](/img/irishman-the-true-story.00_10_46_06.still009.png)

Further searches in the archives of various insurance companies revealed a large number of similar cases. Almost all insurance payouts made immediately after the insurance policy was signed went to Hale's bank account. In addition, the insured died in mysterious ways. In any case, the trail led to the "king of the Osage hills." One prisoner in an Oklahoma prison confessed that Hale had paid him for two murders. The trick Hale used to get rid of one of his accomplices, Ace Kirby, also became known. No matter which direction the FBI special agents investigated - whether they dug into old court cases or discreetly questioned people - each time they came across Hale.

The FBI agents went after the Hale family. The first person they interrogated was Ernest Burkhart. Burkhart spilled everything. Uncle William had terrorized him his whole life, and he obeyed him out of fear for his own life. And then Burkhart provided a long list of people who carried out the banker's bloody deeds. He named the killers of Henry Running Horse, the Smiths, and Anna Brown. Except for Ace Kirby, all of these killers were still alive: some were in prison for other crimes, others were living comfortably in Oklahoma, and the rest were still riding through the mountains with their guns at the ready. Most of these criminals were discovered, and almost all of them without exception quickly gave their testimony.

The killer banker was arrested. He behaved calmly. "I'll be back soon!" Hale exclaimed to reporters watching him being taken to prison. "If necessary, I'll post a million-dollar bail."

And he almost got away with it. Hale hired the most seasoned lawyers in Oklahoma. After the first trial, they succeeded in getting a ruling from the district court that the case was not within the jurisdiction of the federal court. The US Supreme Court overturned this verdict, so a second trial was necessary. During this trial, one of the defense witnesses gave false testimony under oath, and the jurors were "unable" to find Hale guilty. The question remained open. This led to a third trial and Hale's conviction. Then his lawyers appealed and succeeded in getting the verdict overturned. The reason given for the case to be reconsidered was that the proceedings were not held in the proper district.

![](/img/irishman-the-true-story.00_11_43_03.still010.png)

All of this dragged on for another three years, and Hale appeared in court for the fourth time only in 1929. After four trials, on October 29, 1929, the Federal District Court found Hale guilty of only one murder - the murder of Anna Brown's cousin, Henry Roan - and he was sent to Leavenworth prison in Kansas. He was sentenced to life in prison but was released on parole on July 31, 1947. Hale spent the rest of his life in Montana, working on a ranch owned by Benny Binion. He died in Arizona in 1962 and was buried in Wichita, Kansas.

Bryan Burkhart gave testimony during the investigation, becoming a witness rather than a defendant, and never served a sentence. His brother Ernest was sentenced by the state court to life in prison and was sent to the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was released in 1959 and was pardoned in 1966.

Officially, Hale's story in the United States is considered "one of the most fantastic cases of the FBI," and it's hard to disagree with that. After all, isn't it fantastic that the "king of the Osage hills" committed crimes with impunity for so long, the FBI calmly watched what was happening, and the courts listened to Hale's lawyers for three decades?
