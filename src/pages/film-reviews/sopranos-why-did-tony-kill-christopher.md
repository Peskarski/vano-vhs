[The Sopranos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJE-RJqUo77OCZ9xIR3cFwMCb3s21RGA)' story starts out as a "cheerful parable‚Äù, but the series finale hardly resembles a fairy tale - it's just how life is: many characters end up dying, and all choices have consequences. Back in the first season, I knew that the Christopher arc that he so frequently talks about was not likely to end with a happy ending, and there are a number of reasons for that. Today I'm going to explain how the wrong choices led to Moltisanti's demise, and we're going to answer the central question - Why does [Tony kill Christopher](https://youtu.be/r_SXChB-ja4) in the Sopranos' finale? Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

In spite of Christopher's complaints about not having an arc, the reality is that everyone has an arc, though it looks different. Christopher's arc starts from the moment he is born. We all know that the conditions in which we are born greatly affect us, as do the people around us.

Moltisanti's drug addiction was the result of both nature and his upbringing. From a natural point of view, Christopher, like his cousin Tony Blundetto, a gambling nut, appears to have inherited his addiction; Christopher's mother appears to be an alcoholic.

What's worth realizing is that Christopher is Dickie Moltisanti's son, and as we saw in the film The Many Saints of Newark, Dickie was a heavy drinker, sipping whiskey here and there day and night. There's no mention of his other addictions, but alcohol is a serious drug, too. Dad's bad habits will come back to haunt Criss as he begins to follow in his footsteps.

In the Sopranos prequel, we witness June's man killing Christopher's father, making his mother a widow and Chris a fatherless man. I won't get into the wilderness and tell you how much the father figure means in men's maturation and lives, but I think it's clear enough here that it's hard for a mother to raise her son alone. The absence of a father negatively affects not only a kid's childhood, but it all usually drags on and affects guys' adulthood.

To cut a long story short, Christopher wanted a father, and he found one in Tony Soprano. Of course, Tony has a real son, but, to his deepest regret, Anthony Jr. hardly qualifies as a mafioso, besides, the son managed to inherit Tony's main " bargaining chip" - the panic attacks. Soprano, it is not difficult to guess, wants to get a decent successor, who could take over the reins after the retirement or death of the current boss.

Somewhat significantly, Tony and Chrissy represent two different generations of Mobsters: Tony is old school and Christopher is the new generation, which would have made Don Corleone twirl in his coffin for at least twenty-four hours. Pay attention, in the series, most of the older Mafiosi don't use drugs, and more specifically, cocaine or heroin. Once in the ranks of the Mafia even selling drugs was a taboo, but when the bosses realized what profits such a business could bring, the restriction was loosened. Nevertheless, among old-school Mafiosi it was considered unacceptable to use drugs.

Everything changes dramatically, however, when the Mafia "youngsters" grow up. The new generation of Mafiosi doesn't mind getting high, which, of course, interferes with business, because these kids are very easy to make snitches: drugs make you act irrationally, take unnecessary risks, cause extreme aggression or paranoia - recall the ending of Goodfellas, and what drug use and dealing drove Henry Hill to. To get screwed big, it's enough just to sell: David Chase shows perfectly in The Sopranos how the cops bust Pussy - the fat dude was dealing junk in his free time, and after a tough interrogation, the once stand-up Mafioso turns into a rat.

Yeah, for a while Moltisanti manages to keep penning the script, but the entire endeavor falls under Jeannie's wart when Tony finds out about Christopher's little hobby. At that point, Soprano clearly conveys to Christopher that there is no place in their midst for this kind of filmmaker, and states that it's time for Christopher to decide whether he wants to be a filmmaker or a stand-up guy. Obviously, it's not an easy choice, but in the end the desire within Christopher to become a mobster takes over, and the script is shelved.

Let's be clear: Tony loved movies, we often see him sitting in front of the TV. Here's the thing: Moltisanti's screenplay could simply get the family in trouble, so Soprano decides to prevent the problem rather than deal with it afterwards. Especially since it's not just money or respect at stake, it's people's fates. It's one thing to go to "school" for a minor crime, but another thing to go to jail for twenty years under the RICO law - Soprano is not ready to make such a sacrifice. Who knows what Chrissy would say in one of the hundred and twenty pages?

To illustrate what I mean by Chrissy's inexperience, let us recall how Moltisanti made his bones? That's right, by killing Emil Colar. Early on, Moltisanti planned to dump the body in the Colar Brothers dumpster to deliver a message a la Luca Brasi from The Godfather, but the more experienced Pussy convinced him to hide the body elsewhere, as it would bring less trouble to the crew.

Like no one else on the show, Christopher was given a tremendous number of opportunities to break up with the mob. Already in season two, Tony offers Moltisanti to leave the Mafia, stating that if the latter quit and pursue a career in the Hollywood scene, there would be no further repercussions for him to be concerned about. But, Chris, as always, discards the chance.

In fact, he is sympathetic to Tony's ultimatum, because at that moment Moltisanti is two hundred percent loyal to Tony: once he even declares that he will go to hell for Soprano, if needed. Same goes for Tony: he loves his nephew and sees him as a potential successor. Tony wants to teach Chrissy the craft of a wise guy, so he puts his nephew in charge of a phony stock scheme. Shortly after, Chris's underlings make a failed attempt on his life, as a result of which Moltisanti is hospitalized for a long time. Next, Tony personally decides to get even with Chrissy's assailants, and, together with Pussy, gets rid of Matthew Bevilacqua.

After recovering from his wounds, Chris has some great news: the books are about to open, and Uncle Tony tells his nephew to get his suit ready -- soon Moltisanti will be initiated as a " wise guy." Actions speak louder than words, and it is clear to us that Tony is very much emotionally attached to Christopher, or he wouldn't have proposed Moltisanti as a candidate for the " wise guy" title. Let's not forget that along with Chris, Eugene Pontecorvo joins the ranks of the good fellows.

Despite his age (Pontecorvo is 40-45 at the time of the show), Eugene is still an associate member of the mob, the lowest ranking member of the Mafia. My guess is that Eugene wanted to join the wiseguys when he was 15-16 years old, or maybe even younger. Pay attention, it took him about 30 years to become a "soldier," while Christopher was in his thirties at the time of the "oath." Tony wanted to make Christopher "untouchable" as soon as possible. By the way, during the ceremony he spotted a raven on the windowsill and considered it a bad sign.

Moltisanti serves as Tony's voice, relaying his orders to his subordinates to keep the Sopranos safe from potential accusation. However, make no mistake: the Mafia is not a church, everything here has its price, and everyone tries to make his own profit. The same goes for Tony. In September 2002, Soprano takes the unprecedented step of ordering Moltisanti to kill a retired cop, Barry Haidu. Tony claims that Haidu is responsible for the murder of Christopher's dad. Haidu refuses to admit his guilt, but Moltisanti kills him anyway. Personally, I don't think the cop had anything to do with Dickie's murder; this way Tony wants to test Christopher's loyalty. And besides, killing a cop, albeit a retired one, is no joke. By doing the "assignment," Christopher is, you might say, selling his soul to a horned fellow.

Why do I think the cop had nothing to do with it? It was his last day of duty. My guess is that during his police career he helped the Soprano family or Tony personally handle not-so-legitimate things, in other words, the cop knew way too much. After he retires, he becomes a burden to Tony, and Soprano decides to get rid of the potential witness, but also wants to test Christopher.

However, every cloud has a silver lining! Shortly after killing the cop, Paulie Gualtieri checks in on the prison, and Chrissy becomes the acting Capo. This is when Moltisanti's drug habit spirals completely out of control.

Once Tony contacts Chrissy to get rid of Ralphie's corpse, Soprano guesses that Moltisanti is high. Well, that's not difficult, look at how Chrissy covers the fire of the lighter from the wind while in Ralph's apartment. Even though they successfully manage to get rid of the body, Tony decides that his nephew needs some help. Then, after the failed intervention, Tony claims that Christopher will soon go to a hospital to battle his illness. Tony adds that Patsy Parisi will be around to keep an eye on Chris. Although Patsy's job is to keep Chris protected, Tony implies that Patsy has the right to kill Moltisanti if the latter tries to flee the clinic without having completed his therapy. Soprano, as we can see, is very determined: at this point, he begins to sense that Chris is becoming the vulnerable link in their system.

But luckily for Christopher, he has enough energy to finish therapy. Upon his return from rehab, Christopher becomes a new person; he is genuinely committed to staying sober and making his life better. As much as Tony says he wishes Christopher would get better, though, nothing pisses him off more than the thought of seeing someone get any better. Men changing for the better only reminds Tony that he himself is only growing worse as the years roll by. Jumping ahead, as much as Tony condemns Christopher for his setback in the sixth season, this could have been largely prevented if Tony had shown a little more encouragement.

Moltisanti is soon put in charge of a contraband cigarette operation. During Moltisanti's trip to North Carolina for tobacco, Tony and Adriana are involved in an accident, and rumor begins to circulate that the accident was caused by a blow job. Finding this out, Moltisanti gets bullied by Vito Spatafore, gets drunk, and points a gun at Soprano. Personally, I think Tony would have shot Moltisanti - his instinct for self-preservation is just too strong to let Chris hold a grudge against him, but luckily their cousin Tony Blundetto intervenes and thereby saves Chrissy's life.

My point is also that there are no victims in this case, everyone involved is responsible in their own way. For Christopher, it's beyond comprehension that Tony, his uncle, can hook up with Adriana, his fianc√©e, but Chris sleeps with his cousin Greg's girlfriend in the "D-Girl" episode himself. Regarding Tony, I'm sure he wouldn't pass up the opportunity to climb into Andriana's panties: you could say the raccoon saved the whole thing. Between Tony and Ade there is a kind of chemistry; you can see it with the naked eye. Despite the fact that Tony denies any kind of sexual interest in his nephew's bride, it's obvious to everyone. This again shows how much Tony is willing to abandon his principles for his own benefit - we'll come back to that at the end of the video.

At this point, I believe, Christopher's mistrust toward Tony begins to rise. Of course, Blundetto resolves the situation with the doctor's help, but there is one unpleasant thing left: rumors. As soon as the rumor starts to spread, it takes on a life of its own. Just think of the case of Ralph Cifaretto's unfortunate joke about Jeannie Sack. On both occasions, the rumor almost cost some people their lives.

Shortly thereafter, Moltisanti travels with Soprano and Blundetto to Uncle Pat Blundetto's family farm. Together they help Pat move the bodies hidden on the farm as Pat plans to move. Once at the farm, Moltisanti recalls how the two Tonys used to bully him as a child, and their attitude is echoed again as they shower him with mockery about his drug habit.

But the biggest test of Christopher's loyalty happens when Adriana discloses she is an FBI informant.  The FBI expertly gets Adriana on the hook, making her cooperate: Chris, of course, suspects nothing. The agents recommend that Adriana join the Witness Protection Program. Regardless of the risk, Adriana suggests that she will try to persuade Christopher to join the Witness Protection Program along with her. Upon hearing the truth, Moltisanti strangles Ade in a fit of rage, but stops at the last second. After, Chris sort of puts up with the truth, and says he needs to drive off to the gas station.

Chris notices a pathetic kid at a gas station with his family and their shabby car: their belongings loaded onto the roof of the car and tied up with rope, it looks as if the family is on the move in search of a better life. What Christopher sees is who he thinks he will become once he leaves the Mafia. Cristopher is so caught up in the game, so blinded by Tony, there is no other option for him, as he assures himself. At that moment, I think Moltisanti views a normal midclass family, yet we see a distorted versions of them, for that is how Chris perceives the world. Christopher's biggest fear was "the freaking ordinaryness of life."

Once Chrissy has made up his mind, he goes straight to Tony's house to inform Soprano of a scary secret. Tony rushes at Christopher, insisting on Ade's whereabouts. Struggling, Christopher reports that Adriana is at home. Next, Soprano through manipulation makes Adriana believe Moltisanti attempted suicide, further adding that he has already sent Silvio to take her to the emergency room. In the end, they take her to the woods and execute her.

While Christopher tries to reassure himself that he made the right decision, by season six he ceases to be anything like himself. His marriage is to a woman he barely knows, though he has constantly expressed hatred for Adriana, Chris realizes deep down that he has surrendered the one person who truly loved him. Perhaps worst of all, despite the tremendous sacrifice he has made for his family members, Chris gets no appreciation in return.

Christopher visits J.T. Dolan to speak out. J.T. informs Christopher that he doesn't wanna hear about his Mafia affairs. Furious, Christopher pulls out a gun and blows a hole in the writer's skull. Following J.T.'s death, it's clear to us that Christopher's story arc is about to end. Especially since, seconds before J.T. 's demise, Christopher is threatening to spill the beans about Tony Soprano's secrets and unveil the specifics of Ralph Cifaretto's death.

The luck of Christopher comes to an end in the episode "Kennedy and Heidi." Both he and Tony are involved in a severe car accident while returning from a meeting with Phil Leotardo. "Comfortably Numb" is the song he listens to during the ride: the song is sung about the lifeless condition attained while on drugs. Having alcohol and drugs in his blood, Christopher loses control of the car, runs off the road, overturns a few times, before stopping in a ditch. Christopher chooses not to fasten his seatbelt, causing serious internal injuries as a result of the accident, indicated by the blood he is coughing up. Tony, while buckled up, is also hurt, but much less seriously.

He asks Tony to get a cab because he will fail a drug test and get his license taken away. Outraged by the discovery, and afraid that Christopher will dig up dirt, Tony decides to take precautions. Without any hesitation he smashes a window and forcefully grabs Christopher by the nose, as a result of which Christopher suffocates in his own blood.

This finishes Christopher's arc brilliantly, and also rounds out Tony's arc brilliantly. Early in the series, we think that Tony is just an average person, like all of us, with his pros and cons. However, in the show's finale, David Chase reveals that Tony is evil. Soprano descended to the point where he can't even bring himself to fake grieving the loss of a dear one. Many times Tony justifies the murder he committed by referring to the fact that a tree branch hit a child's seat, but let's face it: Tony killed Christopher because he had become a menace to him: after all, Christopher could tell his secrets at any moment.

The reasons for this unhappy ending for Christopher are many, but at the heart of it all is his awareness that he made the wrong decision and can never change the situation again. Which makes Christopher's demise all the sadder, as Moltisanti wastes his opportunity to pursue happiness for the sake of the man who will ultimately end up killing him.
