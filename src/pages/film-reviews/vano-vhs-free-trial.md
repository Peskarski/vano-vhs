Audiobooks are a great way to get a taste of a book without sitting down to read. You can listen to audiobooks in the car, at the gym: and you can read a book at any speed you want to finish reading faster! Audible offers an incredible selection of audiobooks of all genres. Audible also includes thousands of podcasts, from popular favorites to exclusive new series!

The best part is that the app has all those books we love so much: The Godfather, The Family Corleone, The Godfather's Revenge, Wiseguy, Heat 2 by Michael Mann and many, many more! Remember when I told you about the special edition of The Godfather with a Coppola foreword? You can listen to it today! All you have to do is to wacth he video below and follow all the steps!

Goodfellas, they made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. I love books, but I don’t always have time to read a paper version - but with Audible I can always enjoy The Godfather on the road or while driving! I really hope you will enjoy it too!
