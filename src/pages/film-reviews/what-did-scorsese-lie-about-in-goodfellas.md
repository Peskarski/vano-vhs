Hello my Goodfellas! As far back as I can remember I've always wanted to [make a video](https://youtu.be/HqMCro7ih_0) about all the key differences between the movie ["Goodfellas"](https://youtu.be/HqMCro7ih_0) and the true story Henry Hill told us about, for I have found more than twenty major differences and I hope you find it fascinating. Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

* The book specifies that Jimmy's last name is Burke and Conway was given to him at birth and is the last name of his mother, who left her son in an orphanage at the age of two. Also, Henry specifies that when he first met Jimmy, the gangster was twenty-four or twenty-five years old. No doubt De Niro is always great, but in the movie the age difference between Hill and Conway is too large.
* The book also reveals some details about Conway's personal life: in the novel, Conway had two sons. It also describes so specifically why Jimmy got that nickname. Jimmy just loved ripping off truckloads of merchandise. Usually, to ensure the drivers of the ripped-off trucks kept their mouths shut, the wise guys would take their driver's licenses from them: that would mean “we know who you are and where you live”. But Jimmy did things differently: instead, he put a fifty-dollar bill in the drivers' pockets, for which he was nicknamed the gent. 

  But there's no need to think he was a goody-goody or anything like that: Hill explains from the first pages that Conway was someone even the toughest badasses were afraid of. One minute he was clapping you on the shoulders friendly, and now he was banging your head against the wall.

* The head of the criminal organization in which Henry was raised was named Paul Vario, and in the movie he turned into Paul Cicero. At the same time, all the key features of the character were practically intact in the screen version.
* Whereas the movie shows only one Paulie brother called Tuddy, in reality there were as many as five Vario brothers, with Paul as the second oldest. All four brothers, one way or another, contributed to the family business. And it was Tuddy who was next to Hill when he set the cars on fire at the beginning of the movie. Why was this done? The movie doesn't give specific answers. But the book does. The point is that the Vario brothers got a rival who didn't understand in a friendly way, so they had to take extreme measures.
* Henry's first experience with law enforcement was over stolen credit cards. He took them from Tuddy, who didn't bother to check their origin, and an hour after he used them, Henry went to the precinct. The Mafia brought in a lawyer called “Cop-out Louis”. Henry was out on bail, and Tuddy spoke the words about popping his cherry, not Paulie, who was just serving a month for disrespect of justice. So in the novel in this scene there was no Jimmy Conway handing the teenager money for keeping his mouth shut, because the crux of the matter was not the cigarettes, but the credit cards.

* The real Hill, though he had a disdain for all things middle-class, even served in the U.S. Army of his own choice. Henry was not a model soldier over there. He very quickly began to run genuine scams, starting with selling excess in the kitchen. He was also constantly getting into trouble, fights, twisting and turning as fast as he could.
* The script completely omits a rather important character - Paulie's eldest son, Lenny. He and Henry became good friends in a short time and ran scams together. By acquaintance they were assigned to the bricklayers' union and then to a nightclub. It was Lenny, not Tommy, when Hill was arrested the very first time.

  You have to understand that it was very difficult for the ordinary workman to get such a job. Any immigrant laborer would have given his last penny to get such a role, because the pay was excellent, plus the employee received premium health insurance. Naturally, Henry and his friends didn't have to work, they were able to cut corners by running schemes on the side. The job acted as a kind of legal front for them. In case they needed an alibi, they always had one.
* Many remember the scene in the movie referring to the protection that federal agents couldn't understand - the organization gave a roof to those who couldn't go to the cops. The novel reveals this point in more detail - it's about criminals who faced problems and couldn't legally go to the authorities. In other words, there is no talk of nobility.
* The method of arson, which Pesci's character compared to decorating a Christmas tree, was part of Henry Hill's story. They would take Sterno, a brand of warming fuel, and dip toilet paper into it. Then they would attach it to the ceiling and set it on fire. Setting petrol-filled rooms on fire was risky because of the vapors, which could explode before the arsonist could get away.

* The meeting with Curren was thanks, again, to not Tommy, rather to one of Paulie's sons with the same name, Paulie Jr. He was the one who had been chasing a Jewish girl for weeks and had asked a friend to keep him company so that two couples would make out.
* A great deal of the film focuses on Henry and Karen's wedding. In the novel they were married secretly, with Lenny Vario as their best man. Upon their return, the young couple stunned the girl's parents, who were against such a celebration, with the breaking news. A month later they had a pattern Jewish wedding, which even Karren's grandmother was delighted about. Another month later they had a second Italian, old-fashioned wedding. Here it was like the Scorsese variation, with the identical names, presents, and strange wives.
* At Pileggi's, Karren was more in the dark about her husband's business and seriously believed for a while that he was a bricklayer - she even drove him to the construction site in the mornings. Of course, she realized it was about illegal activities, but it wasn't all that obvious.
* The scene in which Henry reprisals his girlfriend's offender, the neighbor across the street, has a more extended version in the novel. The guys standing next to Steve turned out to be his brothers. The scene took place not on the front lawn, but in the backyard. After the attack, Henry didn't just ask to stash the gun. He got in his car and drove around the block, scattering ammunition on the sidewalk. When he returned, there were as many as fourteen cars with cops waiting for him. Hill excused himself for having the gun, saying that the guy was out of his mind, and he'd just beaten him up because of his girlfriend - the cops had been aware of the episode between Steve and Karren the day before.

* The murder of Billy Batts occurred with a number of differences. As for the novel, there, after the insults to Tommy, the reprisal was three weeks away. Butts showed up at Hill's restaurant again, and then he got screwed. In the room, besides the Goodfellas, was a guy from their circle, Alex Corcionne, with a girlfriend. He tried to interfere, but Henry kicked him out so the guy wouldn't get his own hot hand.

  They didn't just take the body to a desolate place - Conway suggested a specific location - an old friend's dog shelter upstate (which he'd sold for cottages). It was Tommy, not Henry, who was behind the wheel. After the stop, Batts was finished off with a shovel and crowbar, without the use of a knife or a gun.
* The first serious case of taking money out of the Air France warehouse, planted by a chief of security, was in reality much more convoluted. They had to steal the keys from one of the two people entrusted with them and make copies. Also, after the case was over, the friends paid off not only Vario, but also Sebastiano "Buster" Aloi, the capo who ran the airport on behalf of the Colombo family. If you wanna learn more about the Lufthansa heist, let me know in the comments down below!
* The circumstances of how the two main characters received a solid sentence in federal prison differ in the two accounts. Henry and Jimmy simply accompanied their associate who had gone to Tampa to collect debts. For almost two years, Hill evaded the start of his sentence. Paulie Vario got as much as 2.5 years, but not for contempt of court, as in the movie, but for tax evasion. On the whole, the story in prison is pretty much the same. Gangsters lived like kings. It's just that the book details Henry's entrepreneurial streak. He grasped a number of ventures that allowed him to make cash. He tricked the prison conditions and, by transferring to work on a dairy farm, even met secretly with his wife in the fields nearby. He fooled the system by showing himself to be an upright inmate: he eventually became literate and graduated from college remotely.

* There is a memorable scene in the [Scorsese film](https://youtu.be/bKHTw8TjgI8) where Paulie warns Henry, who has been released from prison, not to engage in the drug trade. He says that he is not judging the distribution in prison, that he did everything right there, making money for himself and the family. In fact, however, Hill says that when Vario asked him if he had dealt dope in jail, he lied back then and said, of course not.
* Remember Henry's mistress, Janice Rossi, to whom Karren once rushed in hysterically? Well, those scenes are detailed in Pileggi, the only difference being that the real girl's name was Linda, and there was no situation where Paulie and Jimmy came to settle a family dispute that was bad for business.
* Tommy DeSimone - that was the name of the real prototype character, portrayed by Joe Pesci. Major moments with the murders are transferred almost untouched in the movie, but in the Scorsese adaptation he became an essential figure, something that wasn’t present in the book. In the Pileggi, Tommy never utters a single line in the entire book and is a side character. There were no scenes with Tommy's mother and a visit to her, in the process of killing Billy Batts. The movie also featured the acquaintance of the two teenagers, their first deeds together, and Pesci's infamous prank.
* The novel is missing such a character as Frank Carbone - the movie brought together several [Goodfellas](https://youtu.be/HqMCro7ih_0) at once. The frozen corpse in the fridge, for example, belonged to Richie Eaton. It was Angelo Sepe who went with Tommy to kill Stacks Edwards.

* While the script portrayed Henry's bust as the outcome of a drug trafficking case, the real reason was a snitch. The informant turned out to be nineteen-year-old boy Bobby Jarmaine, who had been arrested for drug trafficking. He made a deal with the prosecution, agreeing, in exchange for dropping the charges, to expose a major criminal enterprise. The head of the gang, as far as the informant was aware, was Henry Hill, a former convict who, as far as he knew, was closely associated with Paul Vario of the Lucchese crime family. It was the informant who connected Hill with Jimmy Burke and tipped him to his involvement in the Lufthansa heist. It was the information obtained from the snitch that became the starting point for a large-scale surveillance and eavesdropping operation. The snitch even ratted out his own father, Robert Jermaine Senior, who even gave the go-ahead to eliminate the reckless offspring.
* And now the highlight of the program! It's not in the Pileggi, but in the book written by Hill himself. While Henry was doing time in federal prison, his wife Karen wasted no time in becoming the mistress of his boss, Paulie Vario. Just during the pivotal arrest, this circumstance is revealed to Hill. Consequently, the [Goodfella](https://youtu.be/HqMCro7ih_0) gains the motive to provide testimony against his boss. I think that in those days, sleeping with members' wives was more than unwelcome: this aspect is perfectly illustrated in the movie Casino, when the ant Spilotro had his fun with the mad wife of Lefty.
