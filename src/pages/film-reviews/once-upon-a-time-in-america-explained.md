Hello my Goodfellas! What happens at the end of the movie [Once Upon a Time in America](https://youtu.be/1vR-AeK-4qU)? I'm sure Noodle's enigmatic smile at the end of the movie has kept movie fans awake for years! So, I revised the director's cut of the movie, read the book, examined many interviews of director Sergio Leone, and today you will find out the truth! Spoiler alert! My name is Ivan Piatouski and you are watching [VANO VHS](https://www.youtube.com/@vanovhs)!

So, let's start with the pivotal moment when everything goes wrong for the main characters: that is, when Noodles calls the cops and sets his friends up. In the film, Noodles calls the cops and warns them about an impending raid on the Federal Reserve Bank: Noodles hopes that this way he can keep his friends from certain death. Max knocks Noodles out, so the trio is forced to go on the case without De Niro's character. The gangsters end up resisting arrest and the police murder Max and the team in an unequal fight. Noodles comes to his senses, realizes he has made an irreparable mistake, and rushes to the aid of Moe and his girlfriend.

That's how things were in the movie. Now let's find out how it was in the book. In the novel, Noodles, Max, Cockeye and Patsy are asked to convoy a large shipment of illegal booze belonging to the Organization. After which Max and his friends plan to raid a cherished reserve bank. Noodles, wanting to avoid death for himself and his friends, informs the cops of the impending conveyance. Right at that moment, Noodles' mother dies, he sends her away for the last time and dives into a wave of oblivious drunkenness.

The day before, Max suggests that his friends collect their savings and deposit them in a bank vault under other people's names. What for, you may ask? As we recall, Capone was caught in tax evasion, and Max's gang wanted to avoid a similar fate. Each of the four was assigned a personal box with a cipher. Before he went to escort the shipment of booze, Max deposited the money, and upon successful completion of the operation he was to give the information and keys to each of his friends.

Like in the film, the three friends resist during a police raid and end up dead: Noodles only learns of the tragic news the next day, having come out of a drunken haze. The members of the organization begin to hunt for him, he narrowly escapes, after which he hides out in an opium smokehouse in Chinatown. The book's finale is rather closed-we don't need to speculate, especially since the book has a sequel, "Call Me Duke," where Noodles recounts his adventures after the events of the first book.

Meaning, in the book, Noodles is not smiling in an opium-fueled haze, as if to tell us, the audience: well, guys, what do you think happened? No, I don't want to say that this is a bad thing, on the contrary, such an ending is good for the movie, for which a big kudos to [Sergio Leone](https://youtu.be/1vR-AeK-4qU)!

It should be said that Leone was not the one who invented the opium story: in the book, the opium trips of the main characters are repeated in probably every third chapter. In those days opium was extremely popular among the American people, so Noodles and his friends get familiar with the substance when they graduated from the seventh grade. No, the gang wasn't consuming at the time, they were acting as delivery men for one middle-class gangster. I think the friends started using during the period when Noodles was in the places not so separated: Max was tightly connected to the drug, as he had been selling the product for some time and could perfectly distinguish a good product from a phony one.

It wasn't anything unusual for the quartet, and they occasionally stopped in smokeries to relax a bit. Before one of the important meetings with the head of the organization, the four hang out in an opium den, and in this episode the book describes in great detail one of Noodles' dope trips: an entire chapter consists of detailed descriptions of the images that [De Niro's character](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/robert-deniro-facts/) has seen in his dreams. In short, Noodles sees himself and his friends as the heroes of some fairy tale, they are the knights and the head of the organization is the king. And the visions seem so realistic to Noodles that he forgets about reality, and travels with his friends in an opium dream.

I will now quote one interview with Leone, where he elaborates on the properties of Opium:

> The special thing about opium is that the drug makes you imagine the future as the past. Opium creates a vision of the future. Other drugs only make you see the past. So while Noodles dreams of what his life could be, and while he imagines his future, it gives me, as a European filmmaker, the opportunity to dream within the American myth. And there it is, the perfect combination. We walk together. Noodles with his dream. And I with mine. Because as far as I'm concerned, Noodles never leaves 1930. He dreams everything. The whole movie is Noodles' opium dream.

Recall the scene where Noodles rescues a half-dead Moe by distracting the bandits with an elevator. If most of the movie looks realistic, this scene is more like an action movie with a lone vigilante who is more than capable of taking out the bad guys. I think it looks like a dream, because in the movie the four were opportunistic thugs, and here Noodles turns into a real hero.

I also find the scene where Deborah and Noodles meet in the theater very strange: I think that after what Noodles did to her, she wouldn't let him get within a mile of her - that was the point of no return. But what do we see in this scene? Deborah doesn't hold a grudge against Noodles, you might say she even sees an old friend. If this doesn't even seem strange to you, pay attention to her look: Noodles, after all these years, has turned into an old man who now needs glasses; he is decrepit, slow - time has taken its toll. But look at Deborah -- you might say she hasn't changed at all since the last time they met. And, of course, she wishes Noodles well, warning him in advance not to fall for the trick of the cunning Senator Bailey. In reality, I think she would gladly feed Noodles to the sharks for what he did to her.

And to nicely sum up the scene in the theater - the highlight of the show! Walking out the front door, Noodle meets a teenager who looks just like Max. What's more, he turns out to be Deborah's son from his marriage to Senator Bailey. Where do you see that, if not in a dream?

**Let's move on!**

Despite Deborah's persuasion, Noodles sets out to meet the senator. At the Senator's estate, Noodle sneaks into the main room and comes face to face with Senator Bailey, who has disturbed Noodle's peace of mind. [De Niro's hero](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/robert-deniro-facts/) reveals a terrible truth: Senator Bailey - it's Max! It turns out that he faked his death, pocketed the gang's money and purchased himself a new name and status.

And for what purpose does Max call Noodles after all these years? To make Noodles take his life. And Noodles, being a true gentleman, forgives Max and spares the traitor by refusing to take his life. Doesn't this sound like Noodles' dreams to you? Max turns out to be the villain who takes Noodles' beloved and cash, and then, tortured by no idea what, asks Noodles to take his life. Noodles, as if a highly moral person, having gone through all the misery, is able to forgive all. Once again - Noodles' dreams of his ideal future.

Now let's recall the final scene of the movie: Noodles moves away from Max's estate, then turns around and sees a garbage truck approaching - the car's headlights are blinking. A couple of seconds later we see Max approaching the truck and then disappearing behind it. The next moment we are shown the garbage being processed by the grinders: but we don't see Max's body - not even a trace of blood. The strange thing is, we don't even hear any screams. The truck disappears into the darkness, and from where it disappeared, a column of cars appears with people celebrating something: alcohol in their hands, and music blaring from the cars.

Notice how the cars themselves look: they look like models from the 30s. And the people themselves are probably celebrating the end of Prohibition. In other words, Noodles sees things from his era. Considering that it is the late 70's/early 80's, I assume that by that time the car industry had made a big step forward.

Now, to finally dispel all doubts, let's look at the restored scene in which [De Niro's aging character](https://vano-vhs.com/film-lists/robert-deniro-facts/) comes to visit the graves of his fallen friends: all three are buried in the same building. The cemetery supervisor calls this facility "The Shelter." We'll come back to that title soon, but for now let's look at another scene.

It is about a scene in Florida: Max and Noodles are relaxing on the beach with their girlfriends. Prohibition is over, which means they need to find a new business for themselves. Suddenly Max reveals his plan to raid the Federal Reserve Bank, which would make all four of them incredibly rich.

The events in the book and the movie are very different: while in the movie Max becomes obsessed with the idea over time, in the book the idea to rob the federal reserve was born to him in the 7th grade, and never let him rest until his death. In the book the friends didn't have time to go on the grand scheme, for they had been killed by the cops the day before. In the book, Noodle thinks as soberly as possible: he realizes that a raid on the federal reserve is a suicide mission, something he told Max more than once, but Max didn't care because by then he had developed severe megalomania and was confident of the success of his plan. To assess the situation, Noodles signs up for a day as a delivery man on a truck that ships food to various government organizations, including the reserve. Upon arriving at the location, Noodles becomes even more convinced that, if they go on the case, all of them are dead - there is not a single chance of success: the building is guarded by dozens of guards with machine guns. But back to the Florida scene!

Mad Max draws the Federal Reserve Bank in the sand. And the drawing, as we have already guessed, resembles a " shelter." I think the drawing represents Max taking himself and his friends to the grave, and Noodles understood this better than anyone else. In reality, Max died with his comrades during a botched heist. Max's growing ambition wouldn't have led the gang of four to good things one way or another, and the once "good friendship" "ended badly for everyone."

The movie may not show this clearly, but the book puts serious emphasis on this detail: Max wasn't always strange. From the start, he was a wise leader who led the four to victory, and that was until Max got involved with a blonde psycho. As Noodles put it: she squeezed all the juice out of Max. Max became edgy, tired, even mad. Like in the movie, in the book he acquired himself a throne, on which he sat majestically at the headquarters of the four.

I suppose everyone is wondering about what the enigmatic smile of Noodles breaking through the fourth wall really means. After seeing the "opium dream," where Max becomes the wily Senator Bailey in the style of a tough action movie, Noodles grins, for he realizes that he has made the right choice. Or, he is in shock from what he has seen and still doesn't fully understand where the dream is and where reality is, because the stupefaction has erased the boundaries of his mind. It must be said that in the book Noodles often smiles in a similar manner after each opium trip: his friends notice this and say that Noodles has gone mad - all the time chuckling silently.

So what do you think? [What does Noodles' smile really mean](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YEKTq2P3OfY)? Was it a dream? Write in the comments!
